@article{Selden2016,
abstract = {In a single commodity setting with changing tastes, an individual's consumption plan can be obtained using na{\"{i}}ve or sophisticated choice. We provide two sufficient conditions for when the solutions are unique and agree and the common plan is representable by a non-changing tastes utility. Because the solution is not revised over time, the plan and associated preferences are referred to as being effectively consistent. Afriat-style revealed preference tests are derived. The assumption of effective consistency can mitigate the problems of vulnerability to Dutch Books, non-existence of a competitive equilibrium and the aggregation of heterogeneous agents with changing tastes.},

@article{Kashaev2021,
abstract = {We generalize the stochastic revealed preference methodology of McFadden and Richter (1990) for finite choice sets to settings with limited consideration. Our approach is nonparametric and requires partial choice set variation. We impose a monotonicity condition on attention first proposed by Cattaneo et al. (2020) and a stability condition on the marginal distribution of preferences. Our framework is amenable to statistical testing. These new restrictions extend widely known parametric models of consideration with heterogeneous preferences.},

@article{Quah2022,
abstract = {We explore heterogenous prices as a source of heterogenous or stochastic demand. Heterogenous prices could arise either because there is actual price variation among consumers or because consumers (mis)perceive prices differently. Our main result says the following: if heterogenous prices have a distribution among consumers that is (in a sense) stable across observations, then a model where consumers have a common utility function but face heterogenous prices has precisely the same implications as a heterogenous preference/random utility model (with no price heterogeneity).},

@article{Masatlioglu2015,
abstract = {This paper illustrates how one can deduce preference from observed choices when attention is both limited and random. We introduce a random attention model where we abstain from any particular atten- tion formation and instead consider a large class ofnonparametric ran- dom attention rules. Our intuitive condition, monotonic attention, captures the idea that each consideration set competes for the decision maker's attention. We then develop a revealed preference theory and obtain testable implications. We propose econometric methods for identification, estimation, and inference for the revealed preferences. Finally, we provide a general-purpose software implementation of our estimation and inference results and simulation evidence.},

@article{Chambers2021,
abstract = {As a means for testing for the presence of influence across individuals, we discuss the concept of a stochastic choice function for a group of agents which allows observation of correlation structure (correlated choice rule). We ask when choice behavior is consistent with an underlying unobserved (latent) variable or signal which jointly governs preferences: this hypothesis represents absence of influence. Key is the property of marginality, which demands the independence of any given agents' budgetary choices from the budgets faced by the remaining agents. Marginality permits the construction of well-defined marginal stochastic choice functions. Marginality and non-negativity of an analogue of the Block-Marshack polynomials are equivalent to joint stochastic rationality for small environments. For larger environments, we offer an example of a correlated choice function establishing that each of the marginal stochastic choice functions may be stochastically rational while the correlated choice function is not. Thus, the detection of influence can be aided by studying correlated choice data.},

@article{Kitamura2018,
abstract = {This paper develops and implements a nonparametric test of Random Utility Models. The motivating application is to test the null hypothesis that a sample of cross-sectional demand distributions was generated by a population of rational consumers. We test a necessary and sufficient condition for this that does not rely on any restriction on unobserved heterogeneity or the number of goods. We also propose and implement a control function approach to account for endogenous expenditure. An econometric result of independent interest is a test for linear inequality constraints when these are represented as the vertices of a polyhedron rather than its faces. An empirical application to the U.K. Household Expenditure Survey illustrates computational feasibility of the method in demand problems with 5 goods.},
