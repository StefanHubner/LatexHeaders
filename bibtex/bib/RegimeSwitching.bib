abstract = {Research into time series models of changing variance and covariance, which is often called volatility model, has exploded in the last 10 years. Financial series are characterized by periods of large volatility followed by periods of relative quietness. This type of clustering led to the idea that volatility is predictable. The ARCH and GARCH models were quite successful in predicting volatility compared to more traditional methods. But better predictions are obtained when asymmetries and nonlinearities in the response of volatility to news arriving in the market are taken into account. In this paper we propose a new kind of asymmetric GARCH in which the conditional variance obeys two different regimes with a smooth transition function. In this model, the conditional variance reacts differently to negative and positive shocks and its magnitude on shocks have separate effects. As financial data have very often a high frequency of observation, smooth transition seems a priori better than an abrupt transition. The change of regime occurs when the residuals cross the threshold zero. This threshold GARCH models can be generalized using a smooth transition function FT(??,st) taking continuous values between zero and one. We treat the joint point t* and the speed of adjustment ?? to be two unknown parameters. ?? 2003 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study a general univariate smooth transition autoregressive, star, model. It contains as a special case the self-exciting threshold autoregressive, setar, model. We present three tests for testing linearity against star models and discuss their properties. The power of the tests in small samples is investigated by simulation when the alternative is the logistic star model. One of the tests is identical to Tsay's (1986) test statistic and is recommended only in a special case. Of the two remaining tests with wider applicability, one seems superior to the other in small samples. It is also more powerful than the cusum test recently proposed for testing linearity against setar models.},

@article{Zhao2014,
abstract = {We develop a generally applicable framework for constructing efficient estimators of regression models via quantile regressions. The proposed method is based on optimally combining information over multiple quantiles and can be applied to a broad range of parametric and nonparametric settings. When combining information over a fixed number of quantiles, we derive an upper bound on the distance between the efficiency of the proposed estimator and the Fisher information. As the number of quantiles increases, this upper bound decreases and the asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator approaches the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bound under appropriate conditions. In the case of non-regular statistical estimation, the proposed estimator leads to super-efficient estimation. We illustrate the proposed method for several widely used regression models. Both asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo experiments show the superior performance over existing methods.},
