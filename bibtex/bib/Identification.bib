@article{Manski2007,
abstract = {This article shows how to predict counterfactual discrete choice behavior when the presumed behavioral model partially identifies choice probabilities. The simple, general approach uses observable choice probabilities to partially infer the distribution of types in the population and then applies the results to predict behavior in unrealized choice settings. Two illustrative applications are given. One assumes only that persons have strict preferences. The other assumes strict preferences and utility functions that are linear in attribute bundles, with no restrictions on the shape of the distribution of preference parameters},

@article{Haerdle1989,
abstract = {Let (x1,...,xk, y) be a random vector where y denotes a response on the vector x of predictor variables. In this article we propose a technique [termed average derivative estimation (ADE)] for studying the mean response m(x) = E(y∣ x) through the estimation of the k vector of average derivatives $\delta$ = E(m'). The ADE procedure involves two stages: first estimate $\delta$ using an estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and then approximate m(x) by {\$}\backslashhat{\{}m{\}}(x) = \backslashhat{\{}g{\}}(x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta){\$} , where ĝ is an estimator of the univariate regression of y on {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} . We argue that the ADE procedure exhibits several attractive characteristics: data summarization through interpretable coefficients, graphical depiction of the possible nonlinearity between y and {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and theoretical properties consistent with dimension reduction. We motivate the ADE procedure using examples of models that take the form m(x) = g̃(xT$\beta$). In this framework, $\delta$ is shown to be proportional to $\beta$ and m̂(x) infers m(x) exactly. The focus of the procedure is on the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , which is based on a simple average of kernel smoothers and is shown to be a {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of $\delta$. The estimator ĝ ({\textperiodcentered}) is a standard kernel regression estimator and is shown to have the same properties as the kernel regression of y on xT$\delta$. In sum, the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} converges to $\delta$ at the rate typically available in parametric estimation problems, and m̂(x) converges to E(y∣T$\delta$) at the optimal one-dimensional nonparametric rate. We also give a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , to facilitate inference. We discuss the conditions underlying these results, including how {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent estimation of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} requires undersmoothing relative to pointwise multivariate estimation. We also indicate the relationship between the ADE method and projection pursuit regression. For illustration, we apply the ADE method to data on automobile collisions.},

@article{Tamer2010,
abstract = {Identification in econometric models maps prior assumptions and the data to information about a parameter of interest. The partial identification approach to inference recognizes that this process should not result in a binary answer that consists of whether the parameter is point identified. Rather, given the data, the partial identification approach characterizes the informational content of various assumptions by providing a menu of estimates, each based on different sets of assumptions, some of which are plausible and some of which are not. Of course, more assumptions beget more information, so stronger conclusions can be made at the expense of more assumptions. The partial identification approach advocates a more fluid view of identification and hence provides the empirical researcher with methods to help study the spectrum of information that we can harness about a parameter of interest using a menu of assumptions. This approach links conclusions drawn from various empirical models to sets of assumptions made in a transparent way. It allows researchers to examine the informational content of their assumptions and their impacts on the inferences made. Naturally, with finite sample sizes, this approach leads to statistical complica- tions, as one needs to deal with characterizing sampling uncertainty in models that do not point identify a parameter. Therefore, new methods for inference are developed. These methods construct con- fidence sets for partially identified parameters, and confidence regions for sets of parameters, or identifiable sets.},

abstract = {This paper provides conditions for identification of functionals in nonparametric simultaneous equations models with nonadditive unobservable random terms. The conditions are derived from a characterization of observational equivalence between models. We show that, in the models considered, observational equivalence can be characterized by a restriction on the rank of a matrix. The use of the new results is exemplified by deriving previously known results about identification in parametric and nonparametric models as well as new results. A stylized method for analyzing identification, which is useful in some situations, is also presented.},
