abstract = {Linearity in a causal relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors is a common assumption throughout economics. In this paper we consider the case when the coefficients in this relationship are random and distributed independently from the regressors. Our aim is to identify and estimate the distribution of the coefficients nonparametrically. We propose a kernel-based estimator for the joint probability density of the coefficients. Although this estimator shares certain features with standard nonparametric kernel density estimators, it also differs in some important characteristics that are due to the very different setup we are considering. Most importantly, the kernel is nonstandard and derives from the theory of Radon transforms. Consequently, we call our estimator the Radon transform estimator (RTE). We establish the large sample behavior of this estimatorin particular, rate optimality and asymptotic distribution. In addition, we extend the basic model to cover extensions, including endogenous regressors and additional controls. Finally, we analyze the properties of the estimator in finite samples by a simulation study, as well as an application to consumer demand using British household data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

@article{Khan2010,
abstract = {In weighted moment condition models, we show a subtle link between identification and estimability that limits the practical usefulness of estimators based on these models. In particular, if it is necessary for (point) identification that the weights take arbitrarily large values, then the parameter of interest, though point identified, cannot be estimated at the regular (parametric) rate and is said to be irregularly identified. This rate depends on relative tail conditions and can be as slow in some examples as n-1/4. This nonstandard rate of convergence can lead to numerical instability and/or large standard errors. We examine two weighted model examples: (i) the binary response model under mean restriction introduced by Lewbel (1997) and further generalized to cover endogeneity and selection, where the estimator in this class of models is weighted by the density of a special regressor, and (ii) the treatment effect model under exogenous selection (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)), where the resulting estimator of the average treatment effect is one that is weighted by a variant of the propensity score. Without strong relative support conditions, these models, similar to well known "identified at infinity" models, lead to estimators that converge at slower than parametric rate, since essentially, to ensure point identification, one requires some variables to take values on sets with arbitrarily small probabilities, or thin sets. For the two models above, we derive some rates of convergence and propose that one conducts inference using rate adaptive procedures that are analogous to Andrews and Schafgans (1998) for the sample selection model. ? 2010 The Econometric Society.},

abstract = {We consider empirical measurement of equivalent variation (EV) and compensating variation (CV) resulting from price change of a discrete good using individual-level data when there is unobserved heterogeneity in preferences. We show that for binary and unordered multinomial choice, the marginal distributions of EV and CV can be expressed as simple closed-form functionals of conditional choice probabilities under essentially unrestricted preference distributions. These results hold even when the distribution and dimension of unobserved heterogeneity are neither known nor identified, and utilities are neither quasilinear nor parametrically specified. The welfare distributions take simple forms that are easy to compute in applications. In particular, average EV for a price rise equals the change in average Marshallian consumer surplus and is smaller than average CV for a normal good. These nonparametric point-identification results fail for ordered choice if the unit price is identical for all alternatives, thereby providing a connection to Hausman–Newey's (2014) partial identification results for the limiting case of continuous choice.},

abstract = {Let (x1,...,xk, y) be a random vector where y denotes a response on the vector x of predictor variables. In this article we propose a technique [termed average derivative estimation (ADE)] for studying the mean response m(x) = E(y∣ x) through the estimation of the k vector of average derivatives $\delta$ = E(m'). The ADE procedure involves two stages: first estimate $\delta$ using an estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and then approximate m(x) by {\$}\backslashhat{\{}m{\}}(x) = \backslashhat{\{}g{\}}(x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta){\$} , where ĝ is an estimator of the univariate regression of y on {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} . We argue that the ADE procedure exhibits several attractive characteristics: data summarization through interpretable coefficients, graphical depiction of the possible nonlinearity between y and {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and theoretical properties consistent with dimension reduction. We motivate the ADE procedure using examples of models that take the form m(x) = g̃(xT$\beta$). In this framework, $\delta$ is shown to be proportional to $\beta$ and m̂(x) infers m(x) exactly. The focus of the procedure is on the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , which is based on a simple average of kernel smoothers and is shown to be a {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of $\delta$. The estimator ĝ ({\textperiodcentered}) is a standard kernel regression estimator and is shown to have the same properties as the kernel regression of y on xT$\delta$. In sum, the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} converges to $\delta$ at the rate typically available in parametric estimation problems, and m̂(x) converges to E(y∣T$\delta$) at the optimal one-dimensional nonparametric rate. We also give a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , to facilitate inference. We discuss the conditions underlying these results, including how {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent estimation of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} requires undersmoothing relative to pointwise multivariate estimation. We also indicate the relationship between the ADE method and projection pursuit regression. For illustration, we apply the ADE method to data on automobile collisions.},

We first show that when the number J of component distributions is known a priori, the family of mixture models compatible with the data is a subset of a J(J-1)-dimensional space. When the outcome variable is continuous, this subset is defined by linear constraints, which we characterize exactly. Our identifying assumption has testable implications, which we spell out for J=2.

abstract = {I consider nonparametric identification of nonseparable instrumental variables models with continuous endogenous variables. If both the outcome and first stage equations are strictly increasing in a scalar unobservable, then many kinds of continuous, discrete, and even binary instruments can be used to point-identify the levels of the outcome equation. This contrasts sharply with related work by Imbens and Newey, 2009 that requires continuous instruments with large support. One implication is that assumptions about the dimension of heterogeneity can provide nonparametric point-identification of the distribution of treatment response for a continuous treatment in a randomized controlled experiment with partial compliance.

The analysis is based on the premise that the classical, economically rational consumer will choose a residential location by weighting the attributes of each available alternative and by selecting the alternative that maximizes utility. The assumption of independence in the commonly used multinomial logit model of choice is relaxed to permit a structure of perceived similarities among alternatives. In this analysis, choice is described by a multinomial logit model for aggregates of similar alternatives. Also discussed are methods for controlling the size of data collection and estimation tasks by sampling alternaties from the full set of alternatives.},

abstract = {We introduce methods for estimating nonparametric, nonadditive models with simultaneity. The methods are developed by directly connecting the elements of the structural system to be estimated with features of the density of the observable variables, such as ratios of derivatives or averages of products of derivatives of this density. The estimators are therefore easily computed functionals of a nonparametric estimator of the density of the observable variables. We consider in detail a model where to each structural equation there corresponds an exclusive regressor and a model with one equation of interest and one instrument that is included in a second equation. For both models, we provide new characterizations of observational equivalence on a set, in terms of the density of the observable variables and derivatives of the structural functions. Based on those characterizations, we develop two estimation methods. In the first method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated by a simple matrix inversion and matrix multiplication, analogous to a standard least squares estimator, but with the elements of the matrices being averages of products of derivatives of nonparametric density estimators. In the second method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated in two steps. In a first step, values of the instrument are found at which the density of the observable variables satisfies some properties. In the second step, the estimators are calculated directly from the values of derivatives of the density of the observable variables evaluated at the found values of the instrument. We show that both pointwise estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We test the null hypothesis that a repeated cross-section of demand data was generated by such a population, without restricting unobserved heterogeneity in any form whatsoever. Equivalently, we empirically test McFadden and Richter's (1991) Axiom of Revealed Stochastic Preference (ARSP, to be defined later), using only nonsatiation and the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP) as restrictions on individual level behavior. Doing this is computationally challenging. We provide various algorithms that can be implemented with reasonable computational resources. Also, new tools for statistical inference for inequality restrictions are introduced in order to deal with the high-dimensionality and non-regularity of the problem at hand.},

In this paper we emphasize the close connection of the RCR problem with positron emission tomography (PET). Specifically, we show that the RCR problem can be viewed as an idealized (continuous) version of a PET experiment, by demonstrating that the nonparametric likelihood of the RCR problem is equivalent to that of a specific PET experiment. Consequently, methods independently developed for either of the two problems can be adapted from one problem to the other. To demonstrate the close relation between the two problems we use the estimation method of Beran, Feuerverger and Hall for image reconstruction in PET.},

abstract = {Individual heterogeneity is an important source of variation in demand. Allowing for general heterogeneity is needed for correct welfare comparisons. We consider general heterogeneous demand where preferences and linear budget sets are statistically independent. Only the marginal distribution of demand for each price and income is identified from cross-section data where only one price and income is observed for each individual. Thus, objects that depend on varying price and/or income for an individual are not generally identified, including average exact consumer surplus. We use bounds on income effects to derive relatively simple bounds on the average surplus, including for discrete/continuous choice. We also sketch an approach to bounding surplus that does not use income effect bounds. We apply the results to gasoline demand. We find tight bounds for average surplus in this application, but wider bounds for average deadweight loss.},

abstract = {The idea of duality has proved to be a powerful device in modern work on the economics of consumer behaviour. The authors have used duality to provide an integrated and accessible treatment of this subject. The book focuses on applications of the theory to welfare economics and econometric analysis. The book begins with four chapters that provide a self-contained presentation of the basic theory and its use in applied econometrics. These chapters also include elementary extensions of the theory to labour supply, durable goods, the consumption function, and rationing. The rest of the book is divided into three parts. In the first of these the authors discuss restrictions on choice and aggregation problems. The next part consists of chapters on consumer index numbers; household characteristics, demand, and household welfare comparisons; and social welfare and inequality. The last part extends the coverage of consumer behaviour to include the quality of goods and household production theory, labour supply and human capital theory, the consumption function and intertemporal choice, the demand for durable goods, and choice under uncertainty.},

The results cover (a) simultaneous price-change of multiple alternatives, (b) introduction/elimination of an option, (c) changes in choice-characteristics, and (d) choice among non-exclusive alternatives. In these cases, Marshallian consumer surplus becomes path-dependent, but Hicksian welfare remains well-defined. We demonstrate that under completely unrestricted preference-heterogeneity and income-effects, the distributions of Hicksian welfare are point-identified from structural choice-probabilities in scenarios (a), (b), and only set-identified in (c), (d). Weak-separability restores point-identification in (c). In program-evaluation contexts, our results enable the calculation of compensated-effects, i.e. the program's cash-equivalent and resulting deadweight-loss. They also facilitate theoretically justified cost- benefit comparison of interventions targeting different outcomes, e.g. a tuition-subsidy and a health-product subsidy. Welfare-analyses under endogeneity is briefly discussed. An application to data on choice of fishing-mode illustrates the methods.},

abstract = {Identification in econometric models maps prior assumptions and the data to information about a parameter of interest. The partial identification approach to inference recognizes that this process should not result in a binary answer that consists of whether the parameter is point identified. Rather, given the data, the partial identification approach characterizes the informational content of various assumptions by providing a menu of estimates, each based on different sets of assumptions, some of which are plausible and some of which are not. Of course, more assumptions beget more information, so stronger conclusions can be made at the expense of more assumptions. The partial identification approach advocates a more fluid view of identification and hence provides the empirical researcher with methods to help study the spectrum of information that we can harness about a parameter of interest using a menu of assumptions. This approach links conclusions drawn from various empirical models to sets of assumptions made in a transparent way. It allows researchers to examine the informational content of their assumptions and their impacts on the inferences made. Naturally, with finite sample sizes, this approach leads to statistical complica- tions, as one needs to deal with characterizing sampling uncertainty in models that do not point identify a parameter. Therefore, new methods for inference are developed. These methods construct con- fidence sets for partially identified parameters, and confidence regions for sets of parameters, or identifiable sets.},

abstract = {The triangular model is a very popular way to allow for causal inference in the presence of endogeneity. In this model, an outcome is determined by an endogenous regressor, which in turn is first caused by an instrument. We study the triangular model with random coefficients and additional exogenous regressors in both equations, and establish non-identification of the joint distribution of random coefficients. This implies that counterfactual outcomes are not identified either. Non-identification continues to hold if we confine ourselves to the joint distribution of coefficients in the outcome equation or indeed any marginal, except the one on the endogenous regressor. Nonidentification prevails as well, if we focus on means of random coefficients, implying that IV is asymptotically biased. Based on these insights, we derive bounds on the joint distribution of economically relevant functionals, e.g., counterfactual outcomes, and suggest an additional restriction that allows to point identify the distribution of random coefficients in the outcome equation. We extend the model to cover the case where the regressors and instruments have limited support, and analyze semi- and nonparametric sample counterpart estimators in finite and large samples, and we provide an application to consumer demand.},

Invertibility of demand is important in several contexts, including identification of demand, estimation of demand, testing of revealed preference, and economic theory exploiting existence of an inverse demand function or (in an exchange economy) uniqueness of Walrasian equilibrium prices. We introduce the notion of "connected substitutes" and show that this structure is sufficient for invertibility. The connected substitutes conditions require weak substitution between all goods and sufficient strict substitution to necessitate treating them in a single demand system. The connected substitutes conditions have transparent economic interpretation, are easily checked, and are satisfied in many standard models. They need only hold under some transformation of demand and can accommodate many models in which goods are complements. They allow one to show invertibility without strict gross substitutes, functional form restrictions, smoothness assumptions, or strong domain restrictions. When the restriction to weak substitutes is maintained, our sufficient conditions are also "nearly necessary" for even local invertibility.},

abstract = {Seiring dengan kemajuan ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi yang menjadi pusat perhatian dunia. Maka manusia dituntut untuk menciptakan peralatan-peralatan canggih untuk teknologi muktahir. Baik itu dalam bidang bisnis, perdagangan, kesehatan, militer, pendidikan, komunikasi dan budaya maupun bidang-bidang lainnya. Maka teknologi ini membawa perubahan pada peralatan-peralatan yang dulunya bekerja secara analog mulai dikembangkan secara digital, dan bahkan yang bekerjanya secara manual sekarang banyak dikembangkan secara otomatis, seperti kamera digital, handycam, dan sebagainya, dalam pembacaan pengukuran juga sudah dikembangkan ke dalam teknik digital. Contohnya perangkat Load Cell. Dan keuntungan menggunakan Load Cell adalah untuk mempermudah dalam pembacaan data untuk meminimalkan kesalahan dalam pembacaan data yang disebabkan adanya human error.Pada pemilihan Load Cell bertujuan untuk memilih kecocokan dalam membuat rancang bangun alat uji tarik kapasitas 3 ton, dimana dalam pemilihan ini kami memilih jenis load cell “S” karna alat yang kita rancang adalah uji tarik bukan uji tekan. Dengan kapasitas load cell 5 ton. Untuk membuat jarak aman dalam pengujian specimen ST41. Load Cell menggunakan system perangkat elektronik pengolahan data yang menjadi sebuah kurva tegangan regangan. Data-data yang diperoleh tersebut berupa besarnya pembebanan hasil dari pengujian specimen ST41. Kata},

abstract = {We present new identification results for a class of nonseparable nonparametric simultaneous equations models introduced by Matzkin (2008). These models combine traditional exclusion restrictions with a requirement that each structural error enter through a “residual index.” Our identification results are constructive and encompass a range of special cases with varying demands on the exogenous variation provided by instruments and the shape of the joint density of the structural errors. The most important of these results demonstrate identification even when instruments have limited variation. A genericity result demonstrates a formal sense in which the associated density conditions may be viewed as mild, even when instruments vary only over a small open ball.},

abstract = {The aggregation of heterogeneous individual behavior is one of the most important research topics in economic theory, and it has major implications for macroeconomics, political economics, and empirical and experimental research. Both classic and recent findings are negative. Only under very restrictive assumptions, do aggregate demand or aggregate preferences inherit the properties of their individual counterparts (see the classic works of Gorman, 1953; Eisenberg, 1961; Sonnenschein, 1973; Mantel, 1974; Debreu, 1974; and recent findings by Jackson and Yariv, 2016). The results of the above-cited studies seriously question the representative agent approach, by showing that aggregate behavior does not necessarily match the class of individual behaviors under consideration, and hence the use of a representative agent approach may create problems for welfare analysis and prediction purposes (see, e.g., Kirman, 1992).},

abstract = {Abstract This paper derives sufficient conditions for nonparametric transformation models to be identified and develops estimators of the identified components. Our nonparametric identification result is global, and allows for endogenous regressors. In particular, we show that a completeness assumption combined with conditional independence with respect to one of the regressors suffices for the model to be nonparametrically identified. The identification result is also constructive in the sense that it yields explicit expressions of the functions of interest. We show how natural estimators can be developed from these expressions, and analyze their theoretical properties. Importantly, it is demonstrated that different normalizations of the model lead to different asymptotic properties of the estimators with one normalization in particular resulting in an estimator for the unknown transformation function that converges at a parametric rate. A test for whether a candidate regressor satisfies the conditional independence assumption required for identification is developed. A Monte Carlo experiment illustrates the performance of our method in the context of a duration model with endogenous regressors.},
