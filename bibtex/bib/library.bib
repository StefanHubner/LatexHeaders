@article{Crawford2011,
abstract = {A well known problem with revealed preference methods is that when data are found to satisfy their restrictions it is hard to know whether this should be viewed as a triumph for economic theory, or a warning that these conditions are so undemanding that almost anything goes. This paper allows researchers to make this distinction. Our approach builds on theoretical support in the form of an axiomatic cardinal characterisation of a measure of predictive success due to Selten (1991). We illustrate the idea using a large, nationally representative panel survey of Spanish consumers with broad commodity coverage. The results show that this approach to revealed preference methods can lead us radically to reassess our view of the empirical performance of economic theory.},

abstract = {It is proposed that satisfying, stable relationships reflect intimates' ability to see imperfect partners in idealized ways. In this study of the long-term benefits (or possible costs) of positive illusions, both members of dating couples completed measures of idealization and well-being 3 times in a year. Path analyses revealed that idealization had a variety of self-fulfilling effects. Relationships were most likely to persist-even in the face of conflicts and doubts-when intimates idealized one another the most. Intimates who idealized one another more initially also reported relatively greater increases in satisfaction and decreases in conflicts and doubts over the year. Finally, individuals even came to share their partners' idealized images of them. In summary, intimates who idealized one another appeared more prescient than blind, actually creating the relationships they wished for as romances progressed.},

abstract = {A semiparametric model for observational data combines a parametric form for some component of the data generating process (usually the behavioral relation between the dependent and explanatory variables) with weak nonparametric restrictions on the remainder of the model (usually the distribution of the unobservable errors). This chapter surveys some of the recent literature on semiparametric methods, emphasizing microeconometric applications using limited dependent variable models. An introductory section defines semiparametric models more precisely and reviews the techniques used to derive the large-sample properties of the corresponding estimation methods. The next section describes a number of weak restrictions on error distributions - conditional mean, conditional quantile, conditional symmetry, independence, and index restrictions - and show how they can be used to derive identifying restrictions on the distributions of observables. This general discussion is followed by a survey of a number of specific estimators proposed for particular econometric models, and the chapter concludes with a brief account of applications of these methods in practice. {\textcopyright} 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

The conditions are derived from a characterization of observational equivalence between models. We show that, in the models considered, observational equivalence can be characterized by a restriction on the rank of a matrix. The use of the new results is exemplified by deriving previously known results about identification in parametric and nonparametric models as well as new results. A stylized method for analyzing identification, which is useful in some situations, is also presented.},

@article{Haerdle1989,
abstract = {Let (x1,...,xk, y) be a random vector where y denotes a response on the vector x of predictor variables. In this article we propose a technique [termed average derivative estimation (ADE)] for studying the mean response m(x) = E(y∣ x) through the estimation of the k vector of average derivatives $\delta$ = E(m'). The ADE procedure involves two stages: first estimate $\delta$ using an estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and then approximate m(x) by {\$}\backslashhat{\{}m{\}}(x) = \backslashhat{\{}g{\}}(x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta){\$} , where ĝ is an estimator of the univariate regression of y on {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} . We argue that the ADE procedure exhibits several attractive characteristics: data summarization through interpretable coefficients, graphical depiction of the possible nonlinearity between y and {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and theoretical properties consistent with dimension reduction. We motivate the ADE procedure using examples of models that take the form m(x) = g̃(xT$\beta$). In this framework, $\delta$ is shown to be proportional to $\beta$ and m̂(x) infers m(x) exactly. The focus of the procedure is on the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , which is based on a simple average of kernel smoothers and is shown to be a {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of $\delta$. The estimator ĝ ({\textperiodcentered}) is a standard kernel regression estimator and is shown to have the same properties as the kernel regression of y on xT$\delta$. In sum, the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} converges to $\delta$ at the rate typically available in parametric estimation problems, and m̂(x) converges to E(y∣T$\delta$) at the optimal one-dimensional nonparametric rate. We also give a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , to facilitate inference. We discuss the conditions underlying these results, including how {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent estimation of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} requires undersmoothing relative to pointwise multivariate estimation. We also indicate the relationship between the ADE method and projection pursuit regression. For illustration, we apply the ADE method to data on automobile collisions.},

The simple, general approach uses observable choice probabilities to partially infer the distribution of types in the population and then applies the results to predict behavior in unrealized choice settings. Two illustrative applications are given. One assumes only that persons have strict preferences. The other assumes strict preferences and utility functions that are linear in attribute bundles, with no restrictions on the shape of the distribution of preference parameters},

@article{Tamer2010,
abstract = {Identification in econometric models maps prior assumptions and the data to information about a parameter of interest. The partial identification approach to inference recognizes that this process should not result in a binary answer that consists of whether the parameter is point identified. Rather, given the data, the partial identification approach characterizes the informational content of various assumptions by providing a menu of estimates, each based on different sets of assumptions, some of which are plausible and some of which are not. Of course, more assumptions beget more information, so stronger conclusions can be made at the expense of more assumptions. The partial identification approach advocates a more fluid view of identification and hence provides the empirical researcher with methods to help study the spectrum of information that we can harness about a parameter of interest using a menu of assumptions. This approach links conclusions drawn from various empirical models to sets of assumptions made in a transparent way. It allows researchers to examine the informational content of their assumptions and their impacts on the inferences made. Naturally, with finite sample sizes, this approach leads to statistical complica- tions, as one needs to deal with characterizing sampling uncertainty in models that do not point identify a parameter. Therefore, new methods for inference are developed. These methods construct con- fidence sets for partially identified parameters, and confidence regions for sets of parameters, or identifiable sets.},

We present three tests for testing linearity against star models and discuss their properties. The power of the tests in small samples is investigated by simulation when the alternative is the logistic star model. One of the tests is identical to Tsay's (1986) test statistic and is recommended only in a special case. Of the two remaining tests with wider applicability, one seems superior to the other in small samples. It is also more powerful than the cusum test recently proposed for testing linearity against setar models.},

abstract = {The structural consumer demand methods used to estimate the parameters of collective household models are typically either very restrictive and easy to implement or very general and difficult to estimate. In this paper, we provide a middle ground. We adapt the very general framework of [Browning, M., Chiappori, P.A., Lewbel, A., 2004. Estimating Consumption Economies of Scale, Adult Equivalence Scales, and Household Bargaining Power, Boston College Working Papers in Economics 588] by adding a simple restriction that recasts the empirical model from a highly nonlinear demand system with price variation to a slightly nonlinear Engel curve system. Our restriction has an interpretation in terms of the behaviour of household scale economies and is testable. Our method identifies the levels of (not just changes in) household resource shares, and a variant of equivalence scales called indifference scales.

abstract = {We develop a generally applicable framework for constructing efficient estimators of regression models via quantile regressions. The proposed method is based on optimally combining information over multiple quantiles and can be applied to a broad range of parametric and nonparametric settings. When combining information over a fixed number of quantiles, we derive an upper bound on the distance between the efficiency of the proposed estimator and the Fisher information. As the number of quantiles increases, this upper bound decreases and the asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator approaches the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bound under appropriate conditions. In the case of non-regular statistical estimation, the proposed estimator leads to super-efficient estimation. We illustrate the proposed method for several widely used regression models. Both asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo experiments show the superior performance over existing methods.},
