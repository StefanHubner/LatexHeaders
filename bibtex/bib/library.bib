abstract = {This paper explores the empirical content of the weak axiom of revealed preference (WARP) for repeated cross-sections. In a heterogeneous population, the fraction of consumers who violateWARP is not point identified but can be bounded. These bounds, as well as some nonparametric refinements, correspond to intuitive behavioral assumptions if there are two goods.With three or more goods, such intuitions break down, and plausible assumptions can have counterintuitive implications. We also provide estimators and confidence regions. The empirical application reveals that in the British Family Expenditure Survey, upper bounds are frequently positive but lower bounds are not significantly so. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the President and Fellows of HarvardCollege and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

@article{Chetty2011,
abstract = {How can price elasticities be identified when agents face optimization frictions such as adjustment costs or inattention? I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum. The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1{\%} of earnings.As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings. Pooling estimates from existing studies, I estimate a Hicksian labor supply elasticity of 0.33 on the intensive margin and 0.25 on the extensive margin after accounting for frictions.},

Two estimators based on local linear regressions are proposed. The first estimator applies simple inequality constraints while the second uses rearrangement to maintain quantile monotonicity.

For inference, the paper first establishes a uniform Bahadur representation and then shows that the two estimators converge weakly to the same limiting Gaussian process.

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of testing many moment inequalities where the number of moment inequalities, denoted by {\$}p{\$}, is possibly much larger than the sample size {\$}n{\$}. There is a variety of economic applications where solving this problem allows to carry out inference on causal and structural parameters, a notable example is the market structure model of Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) where {\$}p=2{\^{}}{\{}m+1{\}}{\$} with {\$}m{\$} being the number of firms that could possibly enter the market. We consider the test statistic given by the maximum of {\$}p{\$} Studentized (or {\$}t{\$}-type) inequality-specific statistics, and analyze various ways to compute critical values for the test statistic. Specifically, we consider critical values based upon (i) the union bound combined with a moderate deviation inequality for self-normalized sums, (ii) the multiplier and empirical bootstraps, and (iii) two-step and three-step variants of (i) and (ii) by incorporating the selection of uninformative inequalities that are far from being binding and a novel selection of weakly informative inequalities that are potentially binding but do not provide first order information. We prove validity of these methods, showing that under mild conditions, they lead to tests with the error in size decreasing polynomially in {\$}n{\$} while allowing for {\$}p{\$} being much larger than {\$}n{\$}, indeed {\$}p{\$} can be of order {\$}\backslashexp (n{\^{}}{\{}c{\}}){\$} for some {\$}c {\textgreater} 0{\$}. Importantly, all these results hold without any restriction on the correlation structure between {\$}p{\$} Studentized statistics, and also hold uniformly with respect to suitably large classes of underlying distributions. Moreover, in the online supplement, we show validity of a test based on the block multiplier bootstrap in the case of dependent data under some general mixing conditions.},

The focus is on the key issues that arise from unobserved heterogeneity, nonparticipation and dynamics. We examine the simple "static" labor supply model with proportional taxes and highlight the problems surrounding nonparticipation and missing wages. The difference-in-differences approach to estimation and identification is developed within the context of the labor supply model. We also consider the impact of incorporating nonlinear taxation and welfare program participation. Family labor supply is looked at from both the unitary and collective perspectives. Finally we consider intertemporal models focusing on the difficulties that arise with participation and heterogeneity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We show that transferable utility has no nonparametrically testable implications for marriage stability in settings with a single consumption observation per household and heterogeneous individual preferences across households. This completes the results of Cherchye, Demuynck, De Rock, and Vermeulen (2017), who characterized Pareto efficient household consumption under the assumption of marriage stability without transferable utility. First, we show that the nonparametric testable conditions established by these authors are not only necessary but also sufficient for rationalizability by a stable marriage matching. Next, we demonstrate that exactly the same testable implications hold with and without transferable utility between household members. We build on this last result to provide a primal and dual linear programming characterization of a stable matching allocation for the observational setting at hand. This provides an explicit specification of the marital surplus function rationalizing the observed matching behavior.},

abstract = {1 Abstract We develop a search-matching-and-bargaining model where individuals draw utility from private consumption and leisure, and from a non-market good that is produced in the home using non-market time. We introduce a third source of observed indi-vidual heterogeneity besides wage and education that captures variation in family attitudes. Lastly, a match-specific, stochastic bliss shock induces matching varia-tion given wages, education and family values, and renegotiation and divorce. Using BHPS (1991-2008) data, we take as given changes in wages, education and family values by gender, and study their impact on marriage decisions and intrahousehold resource allocation. The model allows to evaluate how much of the gender division of labor results from gender wage and education differences, how much is reflected by gender differences in preferences and home production, and how much is incorpo-rated into different family attitudes (social norms). We find that our Family Values Index captures a dimension of preference heterogeneity that is nearly as powerful as gender-specific preferences in explaining the gender division of labor.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

@article{MaCurdy2007,
abstract = {This chapter presents a unified set of estimation methods for fitting a rich array of models describing dynamic relationships within a longitudinal data setting. The discussion surveys approaches for characterizing the micro dynamics of continuous dependent variables both over time and across individuals, focusing on two flexible sets of empirical specifications: dynamic simultaneous equations models incorporating error-components structures, and autoregressive quantile models. The chapter is motivated by the principle that, whenever possible, estimation methods should rely on routines available in familiar software packages to make them accessible to a wide range of practitioners. Conventional method-of-moments procedures offer a general apparatus for estimating parameters of panel-data specifications, though one must introduce a series of modifications to overcome challenges arising from: (1) use of unbalanced data structures, (2) weighting to account for stratified sampling inherent in survey longitudinal data, (3) incorporation of predetermined variables in estimation, and (4) computational complexities confronted when estimating large systems of equations with intricate intertemporal restrictions. To allow researchers to separate the estimation of longitudinal time-series specifications into manageable pieces, the discussion describes multi-step approaches that estimate subsets of parameters appearing in a single model component (such as the autoregressive or moving-average structure of the error process) without having to estimate all parameters of the entire model jointly. Such procedures offer a powerful set of diagnostic tools for narrowing model choices and for selecting among specifications that fit the underlying data. To illustrate all of the econometric methods outlined in this chapter, the analysis presents a set of empirical applications summarizing the dynamic properties of hourly wages for adult men using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This lowers the tax penalty on investment there, and also makes it attractive to shift reported taxable income from the U.S. parent corporation to the Puerto Rican affiliate. This paper investigates these two interrelated impacts of taxation by developing a structural econometric model of the joint decisions regarding investment and income shifting, and estimating the model using firm-level data on the activity U.S. corporations in Puerto Rico. The results suggest that the income shifting advantages are the predominant reason for U.S. investment in Puerto Rico.},

@article{Peters2019,
abstract = {The ergodic hypothesis is a key analytical device of equilibrium statistical mechanics. It underlies the assumption that the time average and the expectation value of an observable are the same. Where it is valid, dynamical descriptions can often be replaced with much simpler probabilistic ones — time is essentially eliminated from the models. The conditions for validity are restrictive, even more so for non-equilibrium systems. Economics typically deals with systems far from equilibrium — specifically with models of growth. It may therefore come as a surprise to learn that the prevailing formulations of economic theory — expected utility theory and its descendants — make an indiscriminate assumption of ergodicity. This is largely because foundational concepts to do with risk and randomness originated in seventeenth-century economics, predating by some 200 years the concept of ergodicity, which arose in nineteenth-century physics. In this Perspective, I argue that by carefully addressing the question of ergodicity, many puzzles besetting the current economic formalism are resolved in a natural and empirically testable way.},

We focus on model specification and econometric estimation issues, but we also review some of the main empirical findings. We discuss advantages and limitations of microeconomic data in this context. We briefly review the neoclassical theory of the demand for capital and labour, on which most of the econometric models of investment and employment that we consider are based. We pay particular attention to dynamic factor demand models, based on the assumption that there are costs of adjustment, which have played a prominent role especially in the microeconometric literature on investment. With adjustment costs, current choices depend on expectations of future conditions. We discuss the challenges that this raises for econometric model specification, and some of the solutions that have been adopted. We also discuss estimation issues that arise for dynamic factor demand equations in the context of micro panel data for firms or plants. We then discuss a number of topics that have been the focus of recent microeconometric research on investment and employment. In particular, we review the literatures on investment and financing constraints, relative price effects on investment and employment, investment and uncertainty, investment in research and development (R{\&}D), elasticities of substitution and complementarity between technology, capital and skilled and unskilled labour, and recent work on models with non-convex adjustment costs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We offer a characterization of SCRUMs based on two easy-to-check properties: the classic Monotonicity property and a novel condition , Centrality. The identified collection of preferences and associated probabilities is unique. We show that SCRUMs nest both single-peaked and single-dipped random utility models and establish a stochastic monotone comparative result for the case of SCRUMs.},

@article{Breunig2016,
abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the value l($\phi$) of a linear functional, where the structural function $\phi$ models a nonparametric relationship in presence of instrumental variables. We propose a plug-in estimator which is based on a dimension reduction technique and additional thresholding. It is shown that this estimator is consistent and can attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence under additional regularity conditions. This, however, requires an optimal choice of the dimension parameter m depending on certain characteristics of the structural function $\phi$ and the joint distribution of the regressor and the instrument, which are unknown in practice. We propose a fully data driven choice of m which combines model selection and Lepski's method. We show that the adaptive estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence up to a logarithmic factor. The theory in this paper is illustrated by considering classical smoothness assumptions and we discuss examples such as pointwise estimation or estimation of averages of the structural function $\phi$.},

The results cover (a) simultaneous price-change of multiple alternatives, (b) introduction/elimination of an option, (c) changes in choice-characteristics, and (d) choice among non-exclusive alternatives. In these cases, Marshallian consumer surplus becomes path-dependent, but Hicksian welfare remains well-defined. We demonstrate that under completely unrestricted preference-heterogeneity and income-effects, the distributions of Hicksian welfare are point-identified from structural choice-probabilities in scenarios (a), (b), and only set-identified in (c), (d). Weak-separability restores point-identification in (c). In program-evaluation contexts, our results enable the calculation of compensated-effects, i.e. the program's cash-equivalent and resulting deadweight-loss. They also facilitate theoretically justified cost- benefit comparison of interventions targeting different outcomes, e.g. a tuition-subsidy and a health-product subsidy. Welfare-analyses under endogeneity is briefly discussed. An application to data on choice of fishing-mode illustrates the methods.},

abstract = {The triangular model is a very popular way to allow for causal inference in the presence of endogeneity. In this model, an outcome is determined by an endogenous regressor, which in turn is first caused by an instrument. We study the triangular model with random coefficients and additional exogenous regressors in both equations, and establish non-identification of the joint distribution of random coefficients. This implies that counterfactual outcomes are not identified either. Non-identification continues to hold if we confine ourselves to the joint distribution of coefficients in the outcome equation or indeed any marginal, except the one on the endogenous regressor. Nonidentification prevails as well, if we focus on means of random coefficients, implying that IV is asymptotically biased. Based on these insights, we derive bounds on the joint distribution of economically relevant functionals, e.g., counterfactual outcomes, and suggest an additional restriction that allows to point identify the distribution of random coefficients in the outcome equation. We extend the model to cover the case where the regressors and instruments have limited support, and analyze semi- and nonparametric sample counterpart estimators in finite and large samples, and we provide an application to consumer demand.},

We test the null hypothesis that a repeated cross-section of demand data was generated by such a population, without restricting unobserved heterogeneity in any form whatsoever. Equivalently, we empirically test McFadden and Richter's (1991) Axiom of Revealed Stochastic Preference (ARSP, to be defined later), using only nonsatiation and the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP) as restrictions on individual level behavior. Doing this is computationally challenging. We provide various algorithms that can be implemented with reasonable computational resources. Also, new tools for statistical inference for inequality restrictions are introduced in order to deal with the high-dimensionality and non-regularity of the problem at hand.},

abstract = {In weighted moment condition models, we show a subtle link between identification and estimability that limits the practical usefulness of estimators based on these models. In particular, if it is necessary for (point) identification that the weights take arbitrarily large values, then the parameter of interest, though point identified, cannot be estimated at the regular (parametric) rate and is said to be irregularly identified. This rate depends on relative tail conditions and can be as slow in some examples as n-1/4. This nonstandard rate of convergence can lead to numerical instability and/or large standard errors. We examine two weighted model examples: (i) the binary response model under mean restriction introduced by Lewbel (1997) and further generalized to cover endogeneity and selection, where the estimator in this class of models is weighted by the density of a special regressor, and (ii) the treatment effect model under exogenous selection (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)), where the resulting estimator of the average treatment effect is one that is weighted by a variant of the propensity score. Without strong relative support conditions, these models, similar to well known "identified at infinity" models, lead to estimators that converge at slower than parametric rate, since essentially, to ensure point identification, one requires some variables to take values on sets with arbitrarily small probabilities, or thin sets. For the two models above, we derive some rates of convergence and propose that one conducts inference using rate adaptive procedures that are analogous to Andrews and Schafgans (1998) for the sample selection model. ? 2010 The Econometric Society.},

Special attention is devoted to discussing the challenges associated with, and some of the solutions put forward to, (1) obtain a tractable characterization of the values for the parameters of interest which are observationally equivalent, given the available data and maintained assumptions; (2) estimate this set of values; (3) conduct test of hypotheses and make confidence statements. The chapter reviews advances in partial identification analysis both as applied to learning (functionals of) probability distributions that are well-defined in the absence of models, as well as to learning parameters that are well-defined only in the context of particular models. A simple organizing principle is highlighted: the source of the identification problem can often be traced to a collection of random variables that are consistent with the available data and maintained assumptions. This collection may be part of the observed data or be a model implication. In either case, it can be formalized as a random set. Random set theory is then used as a mathematical framework to unify a number of special results and produce a general methodology to carry out partial identification analysis.},

This is the case for a large class of complete distributions as well as certain sequences of incomplete distributions. As a byproduct of this result, the paper makes two additional contributions. First, I present a definition of weak instruments in the nonparametric instrumental variable model, which is equivalent to the failure of a restricted version of completeness. Second, I show that the null hypothesis of weak instruments, and thus failure of a restricted version of completeness, is testable and I provide a test statistic  and a bootstrap procedure to obtain the critical values.

First, we derive sup-norm convergence rates for computationally simple sieve NPIV (series 2SLS) estimators of {\$}h{\_}0{\$} and its derivatives. Second, we derive a lower bound that describes the best possible (minimax) sup-norm rates of estimating {\$}h{\_}0{\$} and its derivatives, and show that the sieve NPIV estimator can attain the minimax rates when {\$}h{\_}0{\$} is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal root-mean-squared rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are only a logarithmic factor slower than the optimal root-mean-squared rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we use our sup-norm rates to establish the uniform Gaussian process strong approximations and the score bootstrap uniform confidence bands (UCBs) for collections of nonlinear functionals of {\$}h{\_}0{\$} under primitive conditions, allowing for mildly and severely ill-posed problems. Fourth, as applications, we obtain the first asymptotic pointwise and uniform inference results for plug-in sieve t-statistics of exact consumer surplus (CS) and deadweight loss (DL) welfare functionals under low-level conditions when demand is estimated via sieve NPIV. Empiricists could read our real data application of UCBs for exact CS and DL functionals of gasoline demand that reveals interesting patterns and is applicable to other markets.},

We characterize stable marriage with intrahousehold (consumption) transfers but without assuming transferable utility. Our revealed preference characterization generates testable conditions even with a single observation per household and heterogeneous individual preferences across households.

An application to Dutch household data illustrates the usefulness of our theoretical results.},

@book{Parang2012,
abstract = {3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5{\&}prime;-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.},

abstract = {This chapter surveys recent econometric methodologies for inference in large dimensional conditional factor models in finance. Changes in the business cycle and asset characteristics induce time variation in factor loadings and risk premia to be accounted for. The growing trend in the use of disaggregated data for individual securities motivates our focus on methodologies for a large number of assets. The chapter starts with a historical perspective on conditional factor models with a small number of assets for comparison purpose. Then, it outlines the concept of approximate factor structure in the presence of conditional information, and reviews an arbitrage pricing theory for large dimensional factor models in this framework. For inference, we distinguish between two different cases depending on whether factors are observable or not. We focus on diagnosing model specification, estimating conditional risk premia, and testing asset pricing restrictions under increasing cross-sectional and time series dimensions. At the end of the chapter, we provide new empirical findings based on a broad set of factor models and contrast analysis based on individual stocks and standard sets of portfolios. We also discuss the impact on computing time-varying cost of equity for a firm, and summarize differences between results for developed and emerging markets in an international setting.},

The resulting Generalized IV (GIV) models can be used when outcomes are discrete while unobserved variables are continuous, when there are rich specifications of heterogeneity as in random coefficient models, and when there are inequality restrictions constraining observed outcomes and unobserved variables. There are many other applications and classical IV models arise as a special case. The chapter provides characterizations of the identified sets delivered by GIV models. It gives details of the application of GIV analysis to models with an interval censored endogenous variable and to binary outcome models – for example probit models – with endogenous explanatory variables. It illustrates how the identified sets delivered by GIV models can be represented by moment inequality characterizations that have been the focus of recently developed methods for inference. An empirical application to a binary outcome model of female labor force participation is worked through in detail.},

abstract = {When a researcher estimates the parameters of a regression function using information on all 50 states in the United States, or information on all visits to a website, what is the interpretation of the standard errors? Researchers typically report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation, based on viewing the data as a random sample drawn from a large population of interest, even in applications where it is difficult to articulate what that population of interest is and how it differs from the sample. In this paper we explore alternative interpretations for the uncertainty associated with regression estimates. As a leading example we focus on the case where some parameters of the regression function are intended to capture causal effects. We derive standard errors for causal effects using a generalization of randomization inference. Intuitively, these standard errors capture the fact that even if we observe outcomes for all units in the population of interest, there are for each unit missing potential outcomes for the treatment levels the unit was not exposed to. We show that our randomization-based standard errors in general are smaller than the conventional robust standard errors, and provide conditions under which they agree with them. More generally, correct statistical inference requires precise characterizations of the population of interest, the parameters that we aim to estimate within such population, and the sampling process. Estimation of causal parameters is one example where appropriate inferential methods may differ from conventional practice, but there are others.},

It will also be useful for students and teachers in related areas such as Finance Theory (Economics), Electrical Engineering, and Operations Research. The text covers the essentials in a directed and lean way with 28 short chapters. Assuming of readers only an undergraduate background in mathematics, it brings them from a starting knowledge of the subject to a knowledge of the basics of Martingale Theory. After learning Probability Theory from this text, the interested student will be ready to continue with the study of more advanced topics, such as Brownian Motion and Ito Calculus, or Statistical Inference. The second edition contains some additions to the text and to the references and some parts are completely rewritten.},

abstract = {Inverse problems can be described as functional equations where the value of the function is known or easily estimable but the argument is unknown. Many problems in econometrics can be stated in the form of inverse problems where the argument itself is a function. For example, consider a nonlinear regression where the functional form is the object of interest. One can readily estimate the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given a vector of instruments. From this estimate, one would like to recover the unknown functional form. This chapter provides an introduction to the estimation of the solution to inverse problems. It focuses mainly on integral equations of the first kind. Solving these equations is particularly challenging as the solution does not necessarily exist, may not be unique, and is not continuous. As a result, a regularized (or smoothed) solution needs to be implemented. We review different regularization methods and study the properties of the estimator. Integral equations of the first kind appear, for example, in the generalized method of moments when the number of moment conditions is infinite, and in the nonparametric estimation of instrumental variable regressions. In the last section of this chapter, we investigate integral equations of the second kind, whose solutions may not be unique but are continuous. Such equations arise when additive models and measurement error models are estimated nonparametrically. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The model focuses on individual preferences, a consumption technology that captures the economies of scale of living in a couple, and a sharing rule that governs the intra-household allocation of resources. The model is applied to a time series of Dutch consumption expenditure surveys. Our empirical results indicate substantial economies of scale and a wife's share that is increasing in total expenditures. We further calculated two sets of poverty rates: one based on the collective consumption model and one based on the traditional approach with a standard equivalence scale. Poverty among widowers is underestimated by the traditional approach. The same is true for women (men) in elderly couples for the first (later) time periods in our analysis. Finally, we analysed the impact of becoming a widow(er). Based on cross-sectional evidence, we find that the drop in material well-being following the husband's death is rather substantial for women. For men, the picture is reversed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

In it, we develop a general evaluation framework that addresses well-posed economic questions and analyzes agent choice rules and subjective evaluations of outcomes as well as the standard objective evaluations of outcomes. The framework recognizes uncertainty faced by agents and ex ante and ex post evaluations of programs. It also considers distributions of treatment effects. These features are absent from the statistical literature on causal inference. A prototypical model of agent choice and outcomes is used to illustrate the main ideas. We formally develop models for counterfactuals and causality that build on Cowles Commission econometrics. These models anticipate and extend the literature on causal inference in statistics. The distinction between fixing and conditioning that has recently entered the statistical literature was first developed by Cowles economists. Models of simultaneous causality were also developed by the Cowles group, as were notions of invariance to policy interventions. These basic notions are updated to nonlinear and nonparametric frameworks for policy evaluation more general than anything in the current statistical literature on "causal inference". A formal discussion of identification is presented and applied to clearly formulated choice models used to evaluate social programs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Over the last thirty years, a new paradigm in banking theory has overturned economists' traditional vision of the banking sector. The asymmetric information model, extremely powerful in many areas of economic theory, has proven useful in banking theory both for explaining the role of banks in the economy and for pointing out structural weaknesses in the banking sector that may justify government intervention. In the past, banking courses in most doctoral programs in economics, business, or finance focused either on management or monetary issues and their macroeconomic consequences; a microeconomic theory of banking did not exist because the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model of complete contingent markets (the standard reference at the time) was unable to explain the role of banks in the economy. This text provides students with a guide to the microeconomic theory of banking that has emerged since then, examining the main issues and offering the necessary tools for understanding how they have been modeled.This second edition covers the recent dramatic developments in academic research on the microeconomics of banking, with a focus on four important topics: the theory of two-sided markets and its implications for the payment card industry; "non-price competition" and its effect on the competition-stability tradeoff and the entry of new banks; the transmission of monetary policy and the effect on the functioning of the credit market of capital requirements for banks; and the theoretical foundations of banking regulation, which have been clarified, although recent developments in risk modeling have not yet led to a significant parallel development of economic modeling.},

abstract = {We introduce methods for estimating nonparametric, nonadditive models with simultaneity. The methods are developed by directly connecting the elements of the structural system to be estimated with features of the density of the observable variables, such as ratios of derivatives or averages of products of derivatives of this density. The estimators are therefore easily computed functionals of a nonparametric estimator of the density of the observable variables. We consider in detail a model where to each structural equation there corresponds an exclusive regressor and a model with one equation of interest and one instrument that is included in a second equation. For both models, we provide new characterizations of observational equivalence on a set, in terms of the density of the observable variables and derivatives of the structural functions. Based on those characterizations, we develop two estimation methods. In the first method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated by a simple matrix inversion and matrix multiplication, analogous to a standard least squares estimator, but with the elements of the matrices being averages of products of derivatives of nonparametric density estimators. In the second method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated in two steps. In a first step, values of the instrument are found at which the density of the observable variables satisfies some properties. In the second step, the estimators are calculated directly from the values of derivatives of the density of the observable variables evaluated at the found values of the instrument. We show that both pointwise estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Decisions agents make before and after matching can be strategically linked through the match. We demonstrate this linkage by introducing a game in which universities can force students to commit to majors before matriculating or allow students to pick their majors during their studies. The interaction between "matching forces'' (competition for higher quality partners) and "principal-agent forces'' (moral hazard and adverse selection) leads to two different equilibria mirroring the admissions systems in the US and England.   With monetary transfers, our model provides new insight into athletic scholarships. Price competition removes the surplus from enrolling top student athletes, making it impossible to sustain the US equilibrium with competitive wages. We show that a properly designed transfer cap that places additional restrictions on the way universities can pay their athletes achieves the first-best welfare outcome, and can lead to Pareto improvement over the status quo. },

abstract = {We present new evidence on disaggregated profit and loss (P/L) and value-at-risk (VaR) forecasts obtained from a large international commercial bank. Our data set includes the actual daily P/L generated by four separate business lines within the bank. All four business lines are involved in securities trading and each is observed daily for a period of at least two years. Given this unique data set, we provide an integrated, unifying framework for assessing the accuracy of VaR forecasts. We use a comprehensive Monte Carlo study to assess which of these many tests have the best finite-sample size and power properties. Our desk-level data set provides importance guidance for choosing realistic P/L-generating processes in the Monte Carlo comparison of the various tests. The conditional autoregressive value-at-risk test of Engle and Manganelli (2004) performs best overall, but duration-based tests also perform well in many cases.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose an instrumental variable approach to constructing confi dence sets (CS's) for the true parameter in models defined by conditional moment in equalities/equalities. We show that by properly choosing instrument functions, one can transform conditional moment inequalities/equalities into unconditional ones without losing identification power. Based on the unconditional moment inequalities/equalities, we construct CS's by inverting Cram{\'{e}}r-von Mises-type or Kolmogorov-Smirnov-type tests. Critical values are obtained using generalized moment selection (GMS) proce dures. We show that the proposed CS's have correct uniform asymptotic coverage prob abilities. New methods are required to establish these results because an infinite dimensional nuisance parameter affects the asymptotic distributions. We show that the tests considered are consistent against all fixed alternatives and typically have power against «{\~{}}1/2-local alternatives to some, but not all, sequences of distributions in the null hypothesis.

Relating the identified set of the AME to an extremal moment problem, we first show how to obtain sharp bounds on the AME straightforwardly, without any optimization. Then, we consider two strategies to build confidence intervals on the AME. In the first, we estimate the sharp bounds with a semiparametric two-step estimator involving a first-step nonparametric estimator. We derive the asymptotic distributions of these bounds under, mostly, a restriction on the cardinality of the support of the unobserved heterogeneity. The second, very simple strategy does not require any nonparametric estimation but may result in larger confidence intervals. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that both approaches work well in practice, the second being actually very competitive for usual sample sizes.},

abstract = {We study the problem of nonparametric regression when the regressor is endogenous, which is an important nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) regression in econometrics and a difficult ill-posed inverse problem with unknown operator in statistics. We first establish a general upper bound on the sup-norm (uniform) convergence rate of a sieve estimator, allowing for endogenous regressors and weakly dependent data. This result leads to the optimal sup-norm convergence rates for spline and wavelet least squares regression estimators under weakly dependent data and heavy-tailed error terms. This upper bound also yields the sup-norm convergence rates for sieve NPIV estimators under i.i.d. data: the rates coincide with the known optimal L{\^{}}2-norm rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are power of log(n) slower than the optimal L{\^{}}2-norm rates for mildly ill-posed problems. We then establish the minimax risk lower bound in sup-norm loss, which coincides with our upper bounds on sup-norm rates for the spline and wavelet sieve NPIV estimators. This sup-norm rate optimality provides another justification for the wide application of sieve NPIV estimators. Useful results on weakly-dependent random matrices are also provided.},

abstract = {Value at risk models are concerned with the estimation of conditional quantiles of a time series. Formally, these quantities are a function of conditional volatility and the respective quantile of the innovation distribution. The former is often subject to asymmetric dynamic behaviour, e.g. with respect to past shocks. In this paper, we propose a model in which conditional quantiles follow a generalised autoregressive process governed by two parameter regimes with their weights determined by a smooth transition function. We develop a two-step estimation procedure based on a sieve estimator, approximating conditional volatility by using composite quantile regression, which is then used in the generalised autoregressive conditional quantile estimation. We show that the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, and we complement the results with a simulation study. In our empirical application, we consider daily returns of the German equity index (DAX) and the USD/GBP exchange rate. Although only the latter follows a two-regime model, we find that our model performs well in terms of out-of-sample prediction in both cases.},

We show that for binary and unordered multinomial choice, the marginal distributions of EV and CV can be expressed as simple closed-form functionals of conditional choice probabilities under essentially unrestricted preference distributions. These results hold even when the distribution and dimension of unobserved heterogeneity are neither known nor identified, and utilities are neither quasilinear nor parametrically specified. The welfare distributions take simple forms that are easy to compute in applications. In particular, average EV for a price rise equals the change in average Marshallian consumer surplus and is smaller than average CV for a normal good. These nonparametric point-identification results fail for ordered choice if the unit price is identical for all alternatives, thereby providing a connection to Hausman–Newey's (2014) partial identification results for the limiting case of continuous choice.},

@article{Bergvanden2001,
abstract = {Since the early 1980s, the econometric analysis of duration variables has become widespread. This chapter provides an overview of duration analysis, with an emphasis on the specification and identification of duration models, and with special attention to models for multiple durations. Most of the chapter deals with so-called reduced-form duration models, notably the popular Mixed Proportional Hazard (MPH) model and its multivariate extensions. The MPH model is often used to describe the relation between the empirical exit rate and "background variables[equals, rising dots] in a concise way. However, since the applications usually interpret the results in terms of some economic-theoretical model, we examine to what extent the deep structural parameters of some important theoretical models can be related to reduced-form parameters. We subsequently examine the specification and identification of the MPH model in great detail, we provide intuition on what drives identification, and we infer to what extent biases may occur because of misspecifications. This examination is carried out separately for the case of single-spell data and the case of multi-spell data. We also compare different functional forms for the unobserved heterogeneity distribution. Next, we examine models for multiple durations. In the applied econometric literature on the estimation of multiple-duration models, the range of different models is actually not very large. Typically, the models allow for dependence between the duration variables by way of their unobserved determinants, with each single duration following its own MPH model. In addition to this, the model may allow for an interesting "causal[equals, rising dots] effect of one duration on the other, as motivated by an underlying economic theory. For all these models we examine the conditions for identification. Some of these are intimately linked to particular estimation strategies. The multiple-duration model where the marginal duration distributions each satisfy an MPH specification, and the durations can only be dependent by way of their unobserved determinants, is called the Multivariate Mixed Proportional Hazard (MMPH) model. For this model, we address the issue of the dimensionality of the heterogeneity distribution and we compare the flexibility of different parametric heterogeneity distributions. On a number of occasions, we incorporate recent insights from the biostatistical literature on duration analysis, and we contrast points of view in this literature to those in the econometric literature. Finally, throughout the chapter, we discuss the importance of the possible collection of additional data.},

abstract = {We develop a generally applicable framework for constructing efficient estimators of regression models via quantile regressions. The proposed method is based on optimally combining information over multiple quantiles and can be applied to a broad range of parametric and nonparametric settings. When combining information over a fixed number of quantiles, we derive an upper bound on the distance between the efficiency of the proposed estimator and the Fisher information. As the number of quantiles increases, this upper bound decreases and the asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator approaches the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bound under appropriate conditions. In the case of non-regular statistical estimation, the proposed estimator leads to super-efficient estimation. We illustrate the proposed method for several widely used regression models. Both asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo experiments show the superior performance over existing methods.},

The paper specifies moment selection criteria that are GMM analogues of the widely used BIC and AIC model selection criteria. (The latter is not consistent.) The paper also considers downward and upward testing procedures. All of the moment selection procedures discussed in this paper are based on the minimized values of the GMM criterion function for different vectors of moment conditions.

abstract = {We introduce a one dimensional contact process for which births to the right of the rightmost particle and to the left of the leftmost particle occur at rate $\lambda$e (where e is for external). Other births occur at rate $\lambda$i (where i is for internal). Deaths occur at rate 1. The case $\lambda$e = $\lambda$i is the well known basic contact process for which there is a critical value $\lambda$c {\textgreater} 1 such that if the birth rate is larger than $\lambda$c the process has a positive probability of surviving. Our main motivation here is to understand the relative importance of the external birth rates. We show that if $\lambda$e ≤ 1 then the process always dies out while if $\lambda$e {\textgreater} 1 and if $\lambda$i is large enough then the process may survive. We also show that if $\lambda$i {\textless} $\lambda$c the process dies out for all $\lambda$e. To extend this notion to d {\textgreater} 1 we introduce a second process that has an epidemiological interpretation. For this process each site can be in one of three states: infected, a susceptible that has never been infected, or a susceptible that has been infected previously. Furthermore, the rates at which the two types of susceptible become infected are different. We obtain some information about the phase diagram about this case as well.},

The more important issues were fuel and chemical leakage, high pressure reservoirs, hardware failure and ignition sources as well as the human errors in educational center. Building plan, occupancy and evacuation procedure, ability of hazard detection, safety measure, are very important in fire emergency condition. All of these parameters were used as input to the pattern of fire risk assessment. Offering a model based on analytical hierarchy process and failure mode and effect analysis logic, the current study aims to determine the factors influencing the fire risk of an education center. Testing the conceptual model for fire risk assessment was performed in the proposed site. The results showed that the laboratories and chemical warehouses could be raised the level of fire risk in an educational building.},

@article{Chernozhukov2018a,
abstract = {We revisit the classic semi-parametric problem of inference on a low-dimensional parameter $\theta$0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters $\eta$0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for $\eta$0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate $\eta$0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating $\eta$0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of $\theta$0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of $\eta$0 into estimating equations for $\theta$0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be N-1/2 consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest $\theta$0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate $\theta$0; (2) making use of cross-fitting, which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an N-1 -neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

After each series, a speech synthesiser gave emotionally negative, neutral, or positive feedback. Response times and error-rates to calculations following the different feedback categories were analysed. Pupil size was measured during and five seconds after each feedback category. Ratings of the feedback categories were also measured. The ratings showed that the different feedback categories were effective in eliciting congruent emotions in the subjects. The task times were significantly shorter after positive than negative feedback. Error rates were not affected by the feedback. The pupil size was significantly smaller after the feedback than during it. After positive feedback, there was a significantly faster decrease in the pupil diameter than after the other feedback categories. Thus, positive emotional feedback had beneficial effects on human behaviour and physiology in human-computer interaction.},

The method of sieves provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense in the original space and the resulting optimization problem becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without) endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate prior information and constraints, often derived from economic theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity, multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in semi-nonparametric models, typically with optimal convergence rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of semi-nonparametric econometric models via the method of sieves. We present some general results on the large sample properties of the sieve estimates, including consistency of the sieve extremum estimates, convergence rates of the sieve M-estimates, pointwise normality of series estimates of regression functions, root-n asymptotic normality and efficiency of sieve estimates of smooth functionals of infinite-dimensional parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the general results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper considers a nonparametric panel data model with nonadditive unobserved heterogeneity. As in the standard linear panel data model, two types of unobservables are present in the model: individual-speci{\ldots}c e¤ects and idiosyncratic disturbances. The individual-speci{\ldots}c e¤ects enter the structural function nonseparably and are allowed to be correlated with the covariates in an arbitrary manner. The idiosyncratic disturbance term is additively separable from the structural function. Nonparametric identi{\ldots}cation of all the structural elements of the model is established. No parametric distributional or functional form assumptions are needed for identi{\ldots}cation. The identi{\ldots}cation result is constructive and only requires panel data with two time periods. Thus, the model permits nonparametric distributional and counterfactual analysis of heterogeneous marginal e¤ects using short panels. The paper also develops a nonparametric estimation procedure and derives its rate of convergence. As a by-product the rates of convergence for the problem of conditional deconvolution are obtained. The proposed estimator is easy to compute and does not require numeric optimization. A Monte-Carlo study indicates that the estimator performs very well in {\ldots}nite samples. ?This},

We obtain the limit of the kernel estimators for weakly dependent data, even under non-differentiability of the distribution function; the limit Gaussian process is characterized as a stochastic random functional (random generalized function) on the suitable function space. An alternative simple to compute estimator based on the empirical distribution function is proposed for the generalized random functional. For test statistics based on this estimator, limit properties are established.

abstract = {We propose a technique that we call HodgeRank for ranking data that may be incomplete and imbalanced, characteristics common in modern datasets coming from e-commerce and internet applications. We are primarily interested in cardinal data based on scores or ratings though our methods also give specific insights on ordinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method exploits the graph Helmholtzian, which is the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We shall study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory, which provides a way to unravel ranking information from edge flows. In particular, we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the l 2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained-if this is large, then it indicates that the data does not have a good global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency in the ranking data arises locally or globally. When applied to statistical ranking problems, Hodge decomposition sheds light on whether a given dataset may be globally ranked in a meaningful way or if the data is inherently inconsistent and thus could not have any reasonable global ranking; in the latter case it provides information on the nature of the inconsistencies. An obvious advantage over the NP-hardness of Kemeny optimization is that HodgeRank may be easily computed via a linear least squares regression. We also discuss connections with well-known ordinal ranking techniques such as Kemeny optimization and Borda count from social choice theory. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

This is the case if there is no single sample that contains all relevant variables. A special case occurs if longitudinal or panel data are needed but only repeated cross-sections are available. In this chapter we survey sample combination. If two (or more) samples from the same population are combined, there are variables that are unique to one of the samples and variables that are observed in each sample. What can be learned by combining such samples, depends on the nature of the samples, the assumptions that one is prepared to make, and the goal of the analysis. The most ambitious objective is the identification and estimation of the joint distribution, but often we settle for the estimation of economic models that involve these variables or a subset thereof. Sometimes the goal is to reduce biases due to mismeasured variables. We consider sample merger by matching on identifiers that may be imperfect in the case that the two samples have a substantial number of common units. For the case that the two samples are independent, we consider (conditional) bounds on the joint distribution. Exclusion restrictions will narrow these bounds. We also consider inference under the strong assumption of conditional independence. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The same test statistic can be employed under identification, in which case the hypothesis is whether the true model satisfies the posited property. An almost sure consistent bootstrap procedure is provided for obtaining critical values. Possible applications include testing for semiparametric specifications as well as building confidence regions for certain functionals on the identified set.

abstract = {This paper discusses nonparametric estimation of the distribution of random coefficients in a structural model that is nonlinear in the random coefficients. We establish that the problem of recovering the probability density function (pdf) of random parameters falls into the class of convexly-constrained inverse problems. The framework offers an estimation method that separates computational solution of the structural model from estimation. We first discuss nonparametric identification. Then, we propose two alternative estimation procedures to estimate the density and derive their asymptotic properties. Our general framework allows us to deal with unobservable nuisance variables, e.g., measurement error, but also covers the case when there are no such nuisance variables. Finally, Monte Carlo experiments for several structural models are provided which illustrate the performance of our estimation procedure.},

The authors have used duality to provide an integrated and accessible treatment of this subject. The book focuses on applications of the theory to welfare economics and econometric analysis. The book begins with four chapters that provide a self-contained presentation of the basic theory and its use in applied econometrics. These chapters also include elementary extensions of the theory to labour supply, durable goods, the consumption function, and rationing. The rest of the book is divided into three parts. In the first of these the authors discuss restrictions on choice and aggregation problems. The next part consists of chapters on consumer index numbers; household characteristics, demand, and household welfare comparisons; and social welfare and inequality. The last part extends the coverage of consumer behaviour to include the quality of goods and household production theory, labour supply and human capital theory, the consumption function and intertemporal choice, the demand for durable goods, and choice under uncertainty.},

A genericity result demonstrates a formal sense in which the associated density conditions may be viewed as mild, even when instruments vary only over a small open ball.},

We develop a model wherein the resource share of each person in a collective household - defined as their share of household consumption - may be estimated by simple linear regressions using off-the-shelf consumer expenditure micro-data. The model is a linear approximation of Dunbar, Lewbel and Pendakur (2013), whose nonlinear structural model can be computationally difficult. Our model allows for complex household types, including those with multiple adult men and/or women and single parent households. We also provide a simple linear pre-test to check for model identification.


Resource shares are obtained as nonlinear functions of estimated coefficients from OLS regressions. We apply the model to data from 12 countries, and investigate resource shares, gender gaps and individual poverty. We find that equal sharing - the implicit assumption underlying household-level poverty calculations - is always rejected. We also find evidence of large gender gaps in resource shares, and consequently in poverty rates, in a few countries.},

We argue that identification of infinite-dimensional parameters is less crucial than identification of finite-dimensional parameters. We show that in the case of identification failures, a very general family of continuously-regularized estimators is consistent for the best approximation of the parameter of interest and obtain L2 and L∞ finite-sample risk bounds. This class includes Tikhonov, iterated Tikhonov, spectral cut-off, and Landweber-Fridman as special cases. We show that in many cases the best approximation coincides with the structural parameter and can be a useful and tractable object to infer relation between structural variables otherwise. Unlike in the identified case, estimation of the operator may have a non-negligible impact on the estimation accuracy and inference. We develop inferential methods for linear functionals in non-identified models as well as honest uniform confidence sets for the best approximation. Lastly, we demonstrate the discontinuity in the asymptotic distribution for extreme cases of identification failures where we observe a degenerate U-statistics asymptotics.},

abstract = {What types of firms establish tax haven operations, and what purposes do these operations serve? Analysis of affiliate-level data for American firms indicates that larger, more international firms, and those with extensive intrafirm trade and high R and D intensities, are the most likely to use tax havens. Tax haven operations facilitate tax avoidance both by permitting firms to allocate taxable income away from high-tax jurisdictions and by reducing the burden of home country taxation of foreign income. The evidence suggests that the primary use of affiliates in larger tax haven countries is to reallocate taxable income, whereas the primary use of affiliates in smaller tax haven countries is to facilitate deferral of U.S. taxation of foreign income. Firms with sizeable foreign operations benefit the most from using tax havens, an effect that can be evaluated by using foreign economic growth rates as instruments for firm-level growth of foreign investment outside of tax havens. One percent greater sales and investment growth in nearby non-haven countries is associated with a 1.5 to 2{\%} greater likelihood of establishing a tax haven operation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides a survey of the empirical literature on this topic. Its emphasis is on reviewing and elucidating what is known about the magnitude of BEPS. The paper discusses different empirical approaches to identifying income shifting, describes existing data sources, and summarises the findings of the empirical literature. A major theme that emerges from this survey is that in the more recent empirical literature, which uses new and richer sources of data, the estimated magnitude of BEPS is typically much smaller than that found in earlier studies. The paper seeks to provide a framework within which to conceptualise this magnitude and its implications for policy. It concludes by highlighting the importance of existing legal and economic frictions as constraints on BEPS and by discussing possible ways in which future research might model these frictions more precisely.},

abstract = {Instrumental variables have been widely used for estimating the causal effect between exposure and outcome. Conventional estimation methods require complete knowledge about all the instruments' validity; a valid instrument must not have a direct effect on the outcome and not be related to unmeasured confounders. Often, this is impractical as highlighted by Mendelian randomization studies where genetic markers are used as instruments and complete knowledge about instruments' validity is equivalent to complete knowledge about the involved genes' functions. In this article, we propose a method for estimation of causal effects when this complete knowledge is absent. It is shown that causal effects are identified and can be estimated as long as less than 50{\%} of instruments are invalid, without knowing which of the instruments are invalid. We also introduce conditions for identification when the 50{\%} threshold is violated. A fast penalized ℓ1estimation method, called sisVIVE, is introduced for estimating the causal effect without knowing which instruments are valid, with theoretical guarantees on its performance. The proposed method is demonstrated on simulated data and a real Mendelian randomization study concerning the effect of body mass index(BMI) on health-related quality of life (HRQL) index. An R package sisVIVE is available on CRAN. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses structural econometric approaches to auctions. Remarkably, much of what can be learned from auction data can be learned without restrictions beyond those derived from the relevant economic model. This enables us to take a nonparametric perspective in discussing how the structure of auction models can be combined with observables to uncover (or test hypotheses about) primitives of interest in auction markets. We focus on first-price sealed-bid and ascending auctions, including extensions to Dutch auctions, Internet auctions, multi-unit auctions, and multi-object auctions. We consider a wide range of underlying structures of bidder demand and information, as well as a variety of types of data one may encounter in applications. We discuss identification and testable restrictions of these models and present a variety of estimation approaches. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One of the main objectives of empirical analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments is to inform policy decisions that determine how treatments are allocated to individuals with different observable covariates. We propose the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. We show that, when propensity score is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at least at n{\{}{\^{}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}-1/2{\{}{\}}{\}} rate to the maximum obtainable welfare. This holds uniformly over a minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform convergence rate is minimax optimal. In comparison with this benchmark rate, we examine how the uniform convergence rate of the average welfare improves or deteriorates depending on the richness of the class of candidate decision rules, on the distribution of conditional treatment effects, on the lack of knowledge for the propensity score, and on additional smoothness assumptions for the regression functions or propensity scores. We also discuss practically implementable computation for the EWM rule. As an empirical application, we derive an EWM rule for the a training program using the experiment data analyzed in La Londe (1986).},

abstract = {Linearity in a causal relationship between a dependent variable and a set of regressors is a common assumption throughout economics. In this paper we consider the case when the coefficients in this relationship are random and distributed independently from the regressors. Our aim is to identify and estimate the distribution of the coefficients nonparametrically. We propose a kernel-based estimator for the joint probability density of the coefficients. Although this estimator shares certain features with standard nonparametric kernel density estimators, it also differs in some important characteristics that are due to the very different setup we are considering. Most importantly, the kernel is nonstandard and derives from the theory of Radon transforms. Consequently, we call our estimator the Radon transform estimator (RTE). We establish the large sample behavior of this estimatorin particular, rate optimality and asymptotic distribution. In addition, we extend the basic model to cover extensions, including endogenous regressors and additional controls. Finally, we analyze the properties of the estimator in finite samples by a simulation study, as well as an application to consumer demand using British household data. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {When one wants to estimate a model without specifying the functions and distributions parametrically, or when one wants to analyze the identification of a model independently of any particular parametric specification, it is useful to perform a nonparametric analysis of identification. This chapter presents some of the recent results on the identification of nonparametric econometric models. It considers identification in models that are additive in unobservable random terms and in models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms. Single equation models as well as models with a system of equations are studied. Among the latter, special attention is given to structural models whose reduced forms are triangular in the unobservable random terms, and to simultaneous equations, where the reduced forms are functions of all the unobservable variables in the system. The chapter first presents some general identification results for single-equation models that are additive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that are nonadditive in unobservable random terms, single-equation models that possess and index structure, simultaneous equations nonadditive in unobservable random terms, and discrete choice models. Then, particular ways of achieving identification are considered. These include making use of conditional independence restrictions, marginal independence restrictions, shape restrictions on functions, shape restrictions on distributions, and restrictions in both functions and distributions. The objective is to provide insight into some of the recent techniques that have been developed recently, rather than on presenting a complete survey of the literature. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Research into time series models of changing variance and covariance, which is often called volatility model, has exploded in the last 10 years. Financial series are characterized by periods of large volatility followed by periods of relative quietness. This type of clustering led to the idea that volatility is predictable. The ARCH and GARCH models were quite successful in predicting volatility compared to more traditional methods. But better predictions are obtained when asymmetries and nonlinearities in the response of volatility to news arriving in the market are taken into account. In this paper we propose a new kind of asymmetric GARCH in which the conditional variance obeys two different regimes with a smooth transition function. In this model, the conditional variance reacts differently to negative and positive shocks and its magnitude on shocks have separate effects. As financial data have very often a high frequency of observation, smooth transition seems a priori better than an abrupt transition. The change of regime occurs when the residuals cross the threshold zero. This threshold GARCH models can be generalized using a smooth transition function FT(??,st) taking continuous values between zero and one. We treat the joint point t* and the speed of adjustment ?? to be two unknown parameters. ?? 2003 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews recent advances in nonparametric and semiparametric estimation, with an emphasis on applicability to empirical research and on resolving issues that arise in implementation. It considers techniques for estimating densities, conditional mean functions, derivatives of functions and conditional quantiles in a flexible way that imposes minimal functional form assumptions. The chapter begins by illustrating how flexible modeling methods have been applied in empirical research, drawing on recent examples of applications from labor economics, consumer demand estimation and treatment effects models. Then, key concepts in semiparametric and nonparametric modeling are introduced that do not have counterparts in parametric modeling, such as the so-called curse of dimensionality, the notion of models with an infinite number of parameters, the criteria used to define optimal convergence rates, and "dimension-free" estimators. After defining these new concepts, a large literature on nonparametric estimation is reviewed and a unifying framework presented for thinking about how different approaches relate to one another. Local polynomial estimators are discussed in detail and their distribution theory is developed. The chapter then shows how nonparametric estimators form the building blocks for many semiparametric estimators, such as estimators for average derivatives, index models, partially linear models, and additively separable models. Semiparametric methods offer a middle ground between fully nonparametric and parametric approaches. Their main advantage is that they typically achieve faster rates of convergence than fully nonparametric approaches. In many cases, they converge at the parametric rate. The second part of the chapter considers in detail two issues that are central with regard to implementing flexible modeling methods: how to select the values of smoothing parameters in an optimal way and how to implement "trimming" procedures. It also reviews newly developed techniques for deriving the distribution theory of semiparametric estimators. The chapter concludes with an overview of approximation methods that speed up the computation of nonparametric estimates and make flexible estimation feasible even in very large size samples. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper precisely delineates the empirical content of consumer rationality in the following setting: Data are from a repeated cross section; unobserved heterogeneity is completely unrestricted; however, there are only two goods. Simple closed-form expressions determine whether (population level) data are consistent with these assumptions. Bounds on counterfactual distributions of demand, and parameters thereof, follow. A striking finding is that any rationalizable collection of cross-sectional distributions can be rationalized by pretending that the ordering of individual consumers on the budget line is maintained across budgets. Hence, this seemingly strong assumption does not tighten the bounds.},

The identification strategy relies on following individuals who work in different teams over time. I consider two production technologies. For a production function that is additive in worker inputs, I propose a regression estimator and show how to obtain unbiased estimates of variance components that measure the contributions of heterogeneity and sorting. To estimate nonlinear models with complementarity, I propose a mixture approach under the assumption that individual types are discrete, and rely on a mean-field variational approximation for estimation. To illustrate the methods, I estimate the impact of economists on their research output, and the contributions of inventors to the quality of their patents.},

These properties are treated as random fields, which renders nonlinear advection-reaction transport equations stochastic. We derive a deterministic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of the concentration of a solute that undergoes heterogeneous reactions, e.g., precipitation or dissolution. The derivation treats exactly (without linearization) a reactive term in the transport equation which accounts for uncertainty (randomness) in both flow velocity and kinetic rate constants but requires a closure, such as a Large-Eddy-Diffusivity (LED) approximation used in the present analysis. No closure is required when reaction rates are the only source of uncertainty. We use exact concentration PDFs obtained for this setting to analyze the accuracy of our general, LED-based PDF equations.},

These responses are allowed to vary nonparametrically across the income distribution. This is achieved by combining the theory of revealed preference with the semiparametric estimation of consumer expansion paths (Engel curves). We label these expansion path based bounds on demand responses as E-bounds. Deviations from revealed preference restrictions are measured by preference perturbations which are shown to usefully characterize taste change and to provide a stochastic environment within which violations of revealed preference inequalities can be assessed. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Econometric Society.},

abstract = {The field of econometrics has developed rapidly in the last two decades, while the use of up-to-date econometric techniques has become more and more standard practice in empirical work in many fields of economics. Typical topics include unit root tests, cointegration, estimation by the generalized method of moments, heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors, modelling conditional heteroskedasticity, models based on panel data, and models with limited dependent variables, endogenous regressors and sample selection. At the same time econometrics software has become more and more user friendly and up-to-date. As a consequence, users are able to implement fairly advanced techniques even without a basic understanding of the underlying theory and without realizing potential drawbacks or dangers. In contrast, many introductory econometrics textbooks pay a disproportionate amount of attention to the standard linear regression model under the strongest set of assumptions. Needless to say that these assumptions are hardly satisfied in practice (but not really needed either). On the other hand, the more advanced econometrics textbooks are often too technical or too detailed for the average economist to grasp the essential ideas and to extract the information that is needed. This book tries to fill this gap.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper derives sufficient conditions for nonparametric transformation models to be identified and develops estimators of the identified components. Our nonparametric identification result is global, and allows for endogenous regressors. In particular, we show that a completeness assumption combined with conditional independence with respect to one of the regressors suffices for the model to be nonparametrically identified. The identification result is also constructive in the sense that it yields explicit expressions of the functions of interest. We show how natural estimators can be developed from these expressions, and analyze their theoretical properties. Importantly, it is demonstrated that different normalizations of the model lead to different asymptotic properties of the estimators with one normalization in particular resulting in an estimator for the unknown transformation function that converges at a parametric rate. A test for whether a candidate regressor satisfies the conditional independence assumption required for identification is developed. A Monte Carlo experiment illustrates the performance of our method in the context of a duration model with endogenous regressors.},

The framework is similar to that of Hausman and Newey (Econometrica, 1995, 63, 1445–1476), but allows for more general forms of heterogeneity. Individual demands are characterized by a general model that is nonparametric in the regressors, as well as monotonic in unobserved heterogeneity, allowing us to identify the distribution of welfare effects. We first argue why a decision maker should care about this distribution. Then we establish constructive identification, propose a sample counterparts estimator, and analyze its large-sample properties. Finally, we apply all concepts to measuring the heterogeneous effect of a change of gasoline price using US consumer data and find very substantial differences in individual effects across quantiles.},

The analysis is based on the premise that the classical, economically rational consumer will choose a residential location by weighting the attributes of each available alternative and by selecting the alternative that maximizes utility. The assumption of independence in the commonly used multinomial logit model of choice is relaxed to permit a structure of perceived similarities among alternatives. In this analysis, choice is described by a multinomial logit model for aggregates of similar alternatives. Also discussed are methods for controlling the size of data collection and estimation tasks by sampling alternaties from the full set of alternatives.},

abstract = {We apply results in Hu and Schennach (2008) to achieve nonparametric identification of causal effects using noisy proxies for unobserved confounders. We call this the `triple proxy' approach because it requires three proxies that are jointly independent conditional on unobservables. We consider three different choices for the third proxy: it may be an outcome, a vector of treatments, or a collection of auxiliary variables. We compare to an alternative identification strategy introduced by Miao et. al. (2018) in which causal effects are identified using two conditionally independent proxies. We refer to this as the `double proxy' approach. We show that the conditional independence assumptions in the double and triple proxy approaches are non-nested, which suggests that either of the two identification strategies may be appropriate depending on the particular setting.},

The humor strategies that emerge show the immense productivity of repetition as a resource for humor, including several types of imitation and impersonation, as well as other aggressive humor forms that can be subsumed under mocking remarks and replies. The analysis shows how the family uses humor to accomplish various interactional goals, foremost of which is a relational harmony, which is achieved largely through drawing all members into involvement in the interaction through humor.},

Optimal assignments in the latter correspond to stable matchings, and to hedonic equilibria. These assignments are shown to exist in great generality; their marginal indirect payoffs with respect to agent type are shown to be unique whenever direct payoffs vary smoothly with type. Under a generalized Spence-Mirrlees condition (also known as a twist condition) the assignments are shown to be unique and to be pure, meaning the matching is one-to-one outside a negligible set. For smooth problems set on compact, connected type spaces such as the circle, there is a topological obstruction to purity, but we give a weaker condition still guaranteeing uniqueness of the stable match. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Abstract-This paper presents a model of consumer demand that is consistent with the observed expenditure patterns of individual consumers in a long time series of expenditure surveys and is also able to provide a detailed welfare analysis of shifts in relative prices. A nonparametric analysis of consumer expenditure patterns suggests that Engel curves require quadratic terms in the logarithm of expenditure. While popular models of demand such as the Translog or the Almost Ideal Demand Systems do allow flexible price responses within a theoretically coherent structure, they have expenditure share Engel curves that are linear in the logarithm of total expenditure. We derive the complete class of integrable quadratic logarithmic expenditure share systems. A specification from this class is estimated on a large pooled data set of U.K. households. Models that fail to account for Engel curvature are found to generate important distortions in the patterns of welfare losses associated with a tax increase.},

P ∈ (0,1), x ∈ ℝ d, the spatial quantile regression function of order p, characterized by P{\{}Y i[≤ qp(x)|X i=x{\}} = p. Assume that the process has been observed over an N-dimensional rectangular domain of the form I n : = {\{}i = (i 1...,i N) ∈ ℤ N|1 ≤ k ≤n k, k= l,...,N{\}}, with n = (n 1.....n N) ∈ℤ N. We propose a local linear estimator of q p. That estimator extends to random fields with unspecified and possibly highly complex spatial dependence structure, the quantile regression methods considered in the context of independent samples or time series. Under mild regularity assumptions, we obtain a Bahadur representation for the estimators of q p and its first-order derivatives, from which we establish consistency and asymptotic normality. The spatial process is assumed to satisfy general mixing conditions, generalizing classical time series mixing concepts. The size of the rectangular domain I n is allowed to tend to infinity at different rates depending on the direction in ℤ N (non-isotropic asymptotics). The method provides much richer information than the mean regression approach considered in most spatial modelling techniques. {\textcopyright} 2009 ISI/BS.},

In the over twentyyears since Roth published it, the essay has continued to be cited in nearly every new work on Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and their circle. 1 Though much has changed in the intervening years in both the discipline of art history and our state ofknowledge of the figures she critiqued, her attempt to define and historicize what she understood to be a new Cold War aesthetic sensibility in American art has shown remarkable longevity and unmatched explanatory force. 2 "Marcel Duchamp in America: A Self Ready-Made:' published only seven months earlier in Arts (May 1977), constituted a kind ofhistorical and thematic predecessor to the "Aesthetic of Indifference:' for she understood the practice of artistic indifference discussed in the later essay as originating in Duchamp-who was then taken up as a model by the group around John Cage. Together, the two 1977 essays set out a new approach to the history of art, one sensitive not only to questions of political valence, but to what had long been considered mere ephemera in the still-formalist critical context of the time-notably artistic personae, sexuality, and the social historical roots of identity.},

abstract = {The topic of this paper is inference in models in which parameters are defined by moment inequalities and/or equalities. The parameters may or may not be identified. This paper introduces a new class of confidence sets and tests based on generalized moment selection (GMS). GMS procedures are shown to have correct asymptotic size in a uniform sense and are shown not to be asymptotically conservative. The power of GMS tests is compared to that of subsampling, m out of n bootstrap, and " plug-in asymptotic " (PA) tests. The latter three procedures are the only general procedures in the literature that have been shown to have correct asymptotic size (in a uniform sense) for the moment inequality/equality model. GMS tests are shown to have asymptotic power that dominates that of subsampling, m out of n bootstrap, and PA tests. Subsampling and m out of n bootstrap tests are shown to have asymptotic power that dominates that of PA tests.

abstract = {A major challenge in instrumental variable (IV) analysis is to find instruments that are valid, or have no direct effect on the outcome and are ignorable. Typically one is unsure whether all of the putative IVs are in fact valid. We propose a general inference procedure in the presence of invalid IVs, called two-stage hard thresholding with voting. The procedure uses two hard thresholding steps to select strong instruments and to generate candidate sets of valid IVs. Voting takes the candidate sets and uses majority and plurality rules to determine the true set of valid IVs. In low dimensions with invalid instruments, our proposal correctly selects valid IVs, consistently estimates the causal effect, produces valid confidence intervals for the causal effect and has oracle optimal width, even if the so-called 50{\%} rule or the majority rule is violated. In high dimensions, we establish nearly identical results without oracle optimality. In simulations, our proposal outperforms traditional and recent methods in the invalid IV literature. We also apply our method to reanalyse the causal effect of education on earnings.},

We allow for a wide class of distributions of unobserved heterogeneity, subject only to a separability assumption that generalizes Choo and Siow (2006). We first show that the stable matching maximizes a  social gain function that trades off exploiting complementarities in observable characteristic sand matching on unobserved characteristics. We use this result to derive simple closed-form formulae that identify the joint surplus in every possible match and the equilibrium utilities of all participants, given any known distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. If transfers are observed, then the pre-transfer utilities of both partners are also identified. We discuss  computational issues and provide an algorithm that is extremely efficient in important instances. Finally, we present two estimators of the joint surplus and we  revisit Choo and Siow's empirical application  to illustrate the potential of our more general approach. },

As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need. This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Review and miscellanea -- Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and similarity.},

It is divided into an introduction and three sections; a section on estimating demand functions, a section on estimating production functions, and a section on estimating "dynamic" parameters (parameters estimated through their implications on the choice of controls which determine the distribution of future profits). The introduction provides an overview of how these primitives are used in typical I.O. applications, and explains how the individual sections are structured. The topics of the three sections have all been addressed in prior literature. Consequently each section begins with a review of the problems I.O. researchers encountered in using the prior approaches. The sections then continue with a fairly detailed explanation of the recent techniques and their relationship to the problems with the prior approaches. Hopefully the detail is rich enough to enable the reader to actually program up a version of the techniques and use them to analyze data. We conclude each section with a brief discussion of some of the problems with the more recent techniques. Here the emphasis is on when those problems are likely to be particularly important, and on recent research designed to overcome them when they are. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This chapter covers the theory and methods for productivity measurement for nations. Labor, multifactor and total factor productivity measures are defined and are related to each other and to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Their growth over time and relative counterparts are defined as well. Different conceptual meanings have been proposed for a total factor productivity growth (TFPG) index. These are easiest to understand for the case in which the index number problem is absent: a production process that involves one input and one output (a 1-1 process). It is easily seen that four common concepts of TFPG all lead to the same result in the 1-1 case. Moving on to a general N input, M output production scenario, we demonstrate that a Paasche, Laspeyres or Fisher index number formula provides a measure for all four of the concepts of TFPG introduced for the 1-1 case. This is an advantage of the Paasche-Laspeyres-Fisher family of formulas. When multiple inputs or outputs are involved, there is the problem of choosing among alternative functional forms. The axiomatic and economic approaches to index formula choice are reviewed. In addition, we briefly cover the Divisia index number approach and growth accounting, including the KLEMS (capital, labor, energy, materials and services) approach. The gross output measures of the KLEMS approach are contrasted with value added output measures such as GDP. Also, an alternative family of revenue function based productivity growth indexes proposed by Diewert, Kohli and Morrison (DKM) is outlined. The DKM approach facilitates the decomposition of productivity growth into economically meaningful components. This approach is useful, for example, for examining the effects of changes in the terms of trade on productivity growth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We construct test statistics for the hypothesis that Z is exogenous, that is, that U is independent of Z. The test statistics are based on the observation that Z is exogenous if and only if V = FY|Z(Y|Z) is independent of W, and hence they do not require the estimation of the function ϕ. The asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are proved, and a bootstrap approximation of the critical values of the tests is shown to be consistent and to work for finite samples via simulations. An empirical example using the U.K. Family Expenditure Survey is also given. As a byproduct of our results we obtain the asymptotic properties of a kernel estimator of the distribution of V, which equals U when Z is exogenous. We show that this estimator converges to the uniform distribution at faster rate than the parametric n− 1/2-rate.},

abstract = {Let (x1,...,xk, y) be a random vector where y denotes a response on the vector x of predictor variables. In this article we propose a technique [termed average derivative estimation (ADE)] for studying the mean response m(x) = E(y∣ x) through the estimation of the k vector of average derivatives $\delta$ = E(m'). The ADE procedure involves two stages: first estimate $\delta$ using an estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and then approximate m(x) by {\$}\backslashhat{\{}m{\}}(x) = \backslashhat{\{}g{\}}(x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta){\$} , where ĝ is an estimator of the univariate regression of y on {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} . We argue that the ADE procedure exhibits several attractive characteristics: data summarization through interpretable coefficients, graphical depiction of the possible nonlinearity between y and {\$}x{\^{}}T\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , and theoretical properties consistent with dimension reduction. We motivate the ADE procedure using examples of models that take the form m(x) = g̃(xT$\beta$). In this framework, $\delta$ is shown to be proportional to $\beta$ and m̂(x) infers m(x) exactly. The focus of the procedure is on the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , which is based on a simple average of kernel smoothers and is shown to be a {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of $\delta$. The estimator ĝ ({\textperiodcentered}) is a standard kernel regression estimator and is shown to have the same properties as the kernel regression of y on xT$\delta$. In sum, the estimator {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} converges to $\delta$ at the rate typically available in parametric estimation problems, and m̂(x) converges to E(y∣T$\delta$) at the optimal one-dimensional nonparametric rate. We also give a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} , to facilitate inference. We discuss the conditions underlying these results, including how {\$}\backslashsqrt N{\$} consistent estimation of {\$}\backslashhat\backslashdelta{\$} requires undersmoothing relative to pointwise multivariate estimation. We also indicate the relationship between the ADE method and projection pursuit regression. For illustration, we apply the ADE method to data on automobile collisions.},

In this study of the long-term benefits (or possible costs) of positive illusions, both members of dating couples completed measures of idealization and well-being 3 times in a year. Path analyses revealed that idealization had a variety of self-fulfilling effects. Relationships were most likely to persist-even in the face of conflicts and doubts-when intimates idealized one another the most. Intimates who idealized one another more initially also reported relatively greater increases in satisfaction and decreases in conflicts and doubts over the year. Finally, individuals even came to share their partners' idealized images of them. In summary, intimates who idealized one another appeared more prescient than blind, actually creating the relationships they wished for as romances progressed.},

Estimating Consumption Economies of Scale, Adult Equivalence Scales, and Household Bargaining Power, Boston College Working Papers in Economics 588] by adding a simple restriction that recasts the empirical model from a highly nonlinear demand system with price variation to a slightly nonlinear Engel curve system. Our restriction has an interpretation in terms of the behaviour of household scale economies and is testable. Our method identifies the levels of (not just changes in) household resource shares, and a variant of equivalence scales called indifference scales. We apply our methodology to Canadian expenditure data. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

We consider general heterogeneous demand where preferences and linear budget sets are statistically independent. Only the marginal distribution of demand for each price and income is identified from cross-section data where only one price and income is observed for each individual. Thus, objects that depend on varying price and/or income for an individual are not generally identified, including average exact consumer surplus. We use bounds on income effects to derive relatively simple bounds on the average surplus, including for discrete/continuous choice. We also sketch an approach to bounding surplus that does not use income effect bounds. We apply the results to gasoline demand. We find tight bounds for average surplus in this application, but wider bounds for average deadweight loss.},

Both classic and recent findings are negative. Only under very restrictive assumptions, do aggregate demand or aggregate preferences inherit the properties of their individual counterparts (see the classic works of Gorman, 1953; Eisenberg, 1961; Sonnenschein, 1973; Mantel, 1974; Debreu, 1974; and recent findings by Jackson and Yariv, 2016). The results of the above-cited studies seriously question the representative agent approach, by showing that aggregate behavior does not necessarily match the class of individual behaviors under consideration, and hence the use of a representative agent approach may create problems for welfare analysis and prediction purposes (see, e.g., Kirman, 1992).},

This contrasts sharply with related work by Imbens and Newey, 2009 that requires continuous instruments with large support. One implication is that assumptions about the dimension of heterogeneity can provide nonparametric point-identification of the distribution of treatment response for a continuous treatment in a randomized controlled experiment with partial compliance.

The conditions on the structural system under which this procedure can be used in nonlinear and nonparametric simultaneous equations has thus far been unknown. In this paper, we define a new property of functions called control function separability and show it provides a complete characterization of the structural systems of simultaneous equations in which the control function procedure is valid.},

abstract = {Within the framework of statistical learning theory we analyze in detail the so-called elastic-net regularization scheme proposed by Zou and Hastie [H. Zou, T. Hastie, Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net, J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B, 67(2) (2005) 301-320] for the selection of groups of correlated variables. To investigate the statistical properties of this scheme and in particular its consistency properties, we set up a suitable mathematical framework. Our setting is random-design regression where we allow the response variable to be vector-valued and we consider prediction functions which are linear combinations of elements (features) in an infinite-dimensional dictionary. Under the assumption that the regression function admits a sparse representation on the dictionary, we prove that there exists a particular "elastic-net representation" of the regression function such that, if the number of data increases, the elastic-net estimator is consistent not only for prediction but also for variable/feature selection. Our results include finite-sample bounds and an adaptive scheme to select the regularization parameter. Moreover, using convex analysis tools, we derive an iterative thresholding algorithm for computing the elastic-net solution which is different from the optimization procedure originally proposed in the above-cited work. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper makes several contributions to the literature on the important yet difficult problem of estimating functions nonparametrically using instrumental variables. First, we derive the minimax optimal sup-norm convergence rates for nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) estimation of the structural function h{\_}0 and its derivatives. Second, we show that a computationally simple sieve NPIV estimator can attain the optimal sup-norm rates for h{\_}0 and its derivatives when h{\_}0 is approximated via a spline or wavelet sieve. Our optimal sup-norm rates surprisingly coincide with the optimal L{\^{}}2-norm rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are only up to a [log(n)]{\^{}}epsilon (with epsilon {\textless} 1/2) factor slower than the optimal L{\^{}}2-norm rates for mildly ill-posed problems. Third, we introduce a novel data-driven procedure for choosing the sieve dimension optimally. Our data-driven procedure is sup-norm rate-adaptive: the resulting estimator of h{\_}0 and its derivatives converge at their optimal sup-norm rates even though the smoothness of h{\_}0 and the degree of ill-posedness of the NPIV model are unknown. Finally, we present two non-trivial applications of the sup-norm rates to inference on nonlinear functionals of h{\_}0 under low-level conditions. The first is to derive the asymptotic normality of sieve t-statistics for exact consumer surplus and deadweight loss functionals in nonparametric demand estimation when prices, and possibly incomes, are endogenous. The second is to establish the validity of a sieve score bootstrap for constructing asymptotically exact uniform confidence bands for collections of nonlinear functionals of h{\_}0. Both applications provide new and useful tools for empirical research on nonparametric models with endogeneity.},

Starting from the basic treatment of nonlinear models with measurement error assuming a known measurement error distribution or validation data availability, we then turn to the methods relying on more readily available auxiliary variables (such as repeated measurements, instrumental variables or general indicators). These models are then extended to fully nonlinear nonparametric and nonseparable factor models and to general latent (i.e. unobserved) variables models, in which the features of the latent variables are indirectly inferred from their effects on observables. We also identify important connections with related fields, such as nonlinear panel data, limited dependent variables, game theoretic models, dynamic models and set-identification.},

When spouses share consumption equally, separate property or prenuptial agreements can reduce distortions and increase equity.},

@article{Arellano2001,
abstract = {This chapter focuses on two of the developments in panel data econometrics since the Handbook chapter by Chamberlain (1984). The first objective of this chapter is to provide a review of linear panel data models with predetermined variables. We discuss the implications of assuming that explanatory variables are predetermined as opposed to strictly exogenous in dynamic structural equations with unobserved heterogeneity. We compare the identification from moment conditions in each case, and the implications of alternative feedback schemes for the time series properties of the errors. We next consider autoregressive error component models under various auxiliary assumptions. There is a trade-off between robustness and efficiency since assumptions of stationary initial conditions or time series homoskedasticity can be very informative, but estimators are not robust to their violation. We also discuss the identification problems that arise in models with predetermined variables and multiple effects. Concerning inference in linear models with predetermined variables, we discuss the form of optimal instruments, and the sampling properties of GMM and LIML-analogue estimators drawing on Monte Carlo results and asymptotic approximations. A number of identification results for limited dependent variable models with fixed effects and strictly exogenous variables are available in the literature, as well as some results on consistent and asymptotically normal estimation of such models. There are also some results available for models of this type including lags of the dependent variable, although even less is known for nonlinear dynamic models. Reviewing the recent work on discrete choice and selectivity models with fixed effects is the second objective of this chapter. A feature of parametric limited dependent variable models is their fragility to auxiliary distributional assumptions. This situation prompted the development of a large literature dealing with semiparametric alternatives (reviewed in Powell, 1994's chapter). The work that we review in the second part of the chapter is thus at the intersection of the panel data literature and that on cross-sectional semiparametric limited dependent variable models.},

The marginal treatment effect is a choice-theoretic parameter that can be interpreted as a willingness to pay parameter for persons at a margin of indifference between participating in an activity or not. All of the conventional treatment parameters as well as the more economically motivated treatment effects can be generated from a baseline marginal treatment effect. All of the estimation methods used in the applied evaluation literature, such as matching, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity methods, selection and control function methods, make assumptions about the marginal treatment effect which we exposit. Models for multiple outcomes are developed. Empirical examples of the leading methods are presented. Methods are presented for bounding treatment effects in partially identified models, when the marginal treatment effect is known only over a limited support. We show how to use the marginal treatment in econometric cost benefit analysis, in defining limits of policy experiments, in constructing the average marginal treatment effect, and in forecasting the effects of programs in new environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the second step, this set is used to provide information about which moments are “negative.” A Bonferonni-type correction is used to account for the fact that with some probability the moments may not lie in the confidence region. It is shown that the test controls size uniformly over a large class of distributions for the observed data. An important feature of the proposal is that it remains computationally feasible, even when the number of moments is large. The finite-sample properties of the procedure are examined via a simulation study, which demonstrates, among other things, that the proposal remains competitive with existing procedures while being computationally more attractive.},

An interesting problem is to estimate the density f of a random variable X based on n i.i.d. observations from Y = X + $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a measurement error with a known distribution. In this paper, the effect of errors in variables of nonparametric deconvolution is examined. Insights are gained by showing that the difficulty of deconvolution depends on the smoothness of error distributions: the smoother, the harder. In fact, there are two types of optimal rates of convergence according to whether the error distribution is ordinary smooth or supersmooth. It is shown that optimal rates of convergence can be achieved by deconvolution kernel density estimators. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1991 Institute of Mathematical Statistics},

We provide two sufficient conditions for when the solutions are unique and agree and the common plan is representable by a non-changing tastes utility. Because the solution is not revised over time, the plan and associated preferences are referred to as being effectively consistent. Afriat-style revealed preference tests are derived. The assumption of effective consistency can mitigate the problems of vulnerability to Dutch Books, non-existence of a competitive equilibrium and the aggregation of heterogeneous agents with changing tastes.},

We estimate the parameters of the model using a “grouped fixed-effects” estimator that minimizes a least squares criterion with respect to all possible groupings of the cross-sectional units. Recent advances in the clustering literature allow for fast and efficient computation. We provide conditions under which our estimator is consistent as both dimensions of the panel tend to infinity, and we develop inference methods. Finally, we allow for grouped patterns of unobserved heterogeneity in the study of the link between income and democracy across countries.},

Yet so far there seems to be no general theory for their impact on the final estimator's statistical properties. Our paper provides such results.

In this framework, censored, truncated and discrete random variables are interpreted as the manifestation of various sampling schemes for underlying index function models. A unified derivation of the densities and regression representations for index function models is presented. Methods of estimation are discussed with an emphasis on regression and instrumental variable procedures. We demonstrate how a variety of substantive models in labor economics can be given an econometric representation within the index function framework. Models for the analysis of unemployment, labor force participation, job turnover, the impact of interventions on earnings (and other outcomes) and hours of work are formulated as special cases of the general index function model. By casting these diverse models in a common mold we demonstrate the essential commonalities in the econometric approach required for their formulation and estimation.},

We propose a definition of the extensive and intensive margins corresponding respectively to the employment rate and to hours when employed. This definition is robust to the choice of the reference period and we develop a new statistical decomposition that provides bounds on changes at these margins. We focus on longer-run labour supply changes over the period 1977 to 2007 and abstract from the shorter-run impact of recessions. Examining secular changes over this period, we show that both margins matter in explaining changes in total hours. We then provide a detailed analysis across countries and across time by demographic type. Given the large systematic differences we uncover in the importance of these margins by age and gender, it is unlikely that a single explanation will suffice to account for the macroeconomic evolutions in the three countries. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Fiscal Studies {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute for Fiscal Studies.},

We derive non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the regularized M-estimator. Our results exhibit a variance-bias trade-off, with the variance term being governed by a novel measure of the complexity of the parameter set. We also show that the mixing structure affect the variance term by scaling the number of observations; depending on the decay rate of the mixing coefficients, this scaling can even affect the asymptotic behavior. Finally, we propose a data-driven method for choosing the tuning parameters of the regularized estimator which yield the same (up to constants) concentration bound as one that optimally balances the (squared) bias and variance terms. We illustrate the results with several canonical examples.},

Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott develop the basic methods of recursive analysis and illustrate the many areas where they can usefully be applied.After presenting an overview of the recursive approach, the authors develop economic applications for deterministic dynamic programming and the stability theory of first-order difference equations. They then treat stochastic dynamic programming and the convergence theory of discrete-time Markov processes, illustrating each with additional economic applications. They also derive a strong law of large numbers for Markov processes. Finally, they present the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics and show how to apply the methods developed earlier to general equilibrium systems.The authors go on to apply their methods to many areas of economics. Models of firm and industry investment, household consumption behavior, long-run growth, capital accumulation, job search, job matching, inventory behavior, asset pricing, and money demand are among those they use to show how predictions can he made about individual and social behavior. Researchers and graduate students in economic theory will find this book essential.},

In this paper we emphasize the close connection of the RCR problem with positron emission tomography (PET). Specifically, we show that the RCR problem can be viewed as an idealized (continuous) version of a PET experiment, by demonstrating that the nonparametric likelihood of the RCR problem is equivalent to that of a specific PET experiment. Consequently, methods independently developed for either of the two problems can be adapted from one problem to the other. To demonstrate the close relation between the two problems we use the estimation method of Beran, Feuerverger and Hall for image reconstruction in PET.},

abstract = {Identification in econometric models maps prior assumptions and the data to information about a parameter of interest. The partial identification approach to inference recognizes that this process should not result in a binary answer that consists of whether the parameter is point identified. Rather, given the data, the partial identification approach characterizes the informational content of various assumptions by providing a menu of estimates, each based on different sets of assumptions, some of which are plausible and some of which are not. Of course, more assumptions beget more information, so stronger conclusions can be made at the expense of more assumptions. The partial identification approach advocates a more fluid view of identification and hence provides the empirical researcher with methods to help study the spectrum of information that we can harness about a parameter of interest using a menu of assumptions. This approach links conclusions drawn from various empirical models to sets of assumptions made in a transparent way. It allows researchers to examine the informational content of their assumptions and their impacts on the inferences made. Naturally, with finite sample sizes, this approach leads to statistical complica- tions, as one needs to deal with characterizing sampling uncertainty in models that do not point identify a parameter. Therefore, new methods for inference are developed. These methods construct con- fidence sets for partially identified parameters, and confidence regions for sets of parameters, or identifiable sets.},

We first show that as returns to human capital increase, couples at the top of the income distribution should spend more time with their children. This in turn should reinforce assortative matching, in a sense that we precisely define. We then embed the model into a transferable utility matching framework with random preferences, {\`{a}} la Choo and Siow (2006), which we estimate using US marriage data for individuals born between 1943 and 1972. We find that the preference for partners of the same education has significantly increased for white individuals, particularly for the highly educated. We find no evidence of such an increase for black individuals. Moreover, in line with theoretical predictions, we find that the "marital college-plus premium" has increased for women but not for men.},

abstract = {We consider the invertibility (injectivity) of a nonparametric nonseparable demand system. Invertibility of demand is important in several contexts, including identification of demand, estimation of demand, testing of revealed preference, and economic theory exploiting existence of an inverse demand function or (in an exchange economy) uniqueness of Walrasian equilibrium prices. We introduce the notion of "connected substitutes" and show that this structure is sufficient for invertibility. The connected substitutes conditions require weak substitution between all goods and sufficient strict substitution to necessitate treating them in a single demand system. The connected substitutes conditions have transparent economic interpretation, are easily checked, and are satisfied in many standard models. They need only hold under some transformation of demand and can accommodate many models in which goods are complements. They allow one to show invertibility without strict gross substitutes, functional form restrictions, smoothness assumptions, or strong domain restrictions. When the restriction to weak substitutes is maintained, our sufficient conditions are also "nearly necessary" for even local invertibility.},

Our approach employs series approximations that exploit the additive structure of the model. The first step comprises the nonparametric estimation of the reduced form and the corresponding residuals. The second step is the estimation of the primary equation via nonparametric regression with the reduced form residuals included as a regressor. We derive consistency and asymptotic normality results for our estimator, including optimal convergence rates. Finally we present an empirical example, based on the relationship between the hourly wage rate and annual hours worked, which illustrates the utility of our approach.},

This paper allows researchers to make this distinction. Our approach builds on theoretical support in the form of an axiomatic cardinal characterisation of a measure of predictive success due to Selten (1991). We illustrate the idea using a large, nationally representative panel survey of Spanish consumers with broad commodity coverage. The results show that this approach to revealed preference methods can lead us radically to reassess our view of the empirical performance of economic theory.},

We prove that if only certain pairs of blocks of M commute, then the two procedures still give the same element of R, for a suitable definition of noncommutative determinants.

The measure of the gap is the smallest Frobenius norm of the correcting matrix function that would yield a Slutsky matrix with its standard rationality properties (symmetry, singularity, and negative semidefiniteness). As a result, we are able to suggest a useful classification of departures from rationality, corresponding to three anomalies: inattentiveness to changes in purchasing power, money illusion, and violations of the compensated law of demand. Errors in comparative-statics predictions from assuming rationality are decomposed as the sum of a behavioral error (due to the agent) and a specification error (due to the modeller).

abstract = {The field of econometrics has developed rapidly in the last two decades, while the use of up-to-date econometric techniques has become more and more standard practice in empirical work in many fields of economics. Typical topics include unit root tests, cointegration, estimation by the generalized method of moments, heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors, modelling conditional heteroskedasticity, models based on panel data, and models with limited dependent variables, endogenous regressors and sample selection. At the same time econometrics software has become more and more user friendly and up-to-date. As a consequence, users are able to implement fairly advanced techniques even without a basic understanding of the underlying theory and without realizing potential drawbacks or dangers. In contrast, many introductory econometrics textbooks pay a disproportionate amount of attention to the standard linear regression model under the strongest set of assumptions. Needless to say that these assumptions are hardly satisfied in practice (but not really needed either). On the other hand, the more advanced econometrics textbooks are often too technical or too detailed for the average economist to grasp the essential ideas and to extract the information that is needed. This book tries to fill this gap.},

To address this problem, we promote a nonlinear shrinkage estimator that is more flexible than previous linear shrinkage estimators and has just the right number of free parameters (i.e., the Goldilocks principle). This number is the same as the number of assets. Our nonlinear shrinkage estimator is asymptotically optimal for portfolio selection when the number of assets is of the same magnitude as the sample size. In backtests with historical stock return data, it performs better than previous proposals and, in particular, it dominates linear shrinkage. (JEL C13, C58, G11)},

The fundamental objects that we deal with in calculus are functions. This chapter prepares the way for calculus by discussing the basic ideas concerning functions, their graphs, and ways of transforming and combining them. We stress that a function can be represented in different ways: by an equation, in a table, by a graph, or in words. We look at the main types of functions that occur in calculus and describe the process of using these func-tions as mathematical models of real-world phenomena. We also discuss the use of graphing calculators and graphing software for computers. |||| 1.1 Four Ways to Represent a Function Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four situations. A. The area of a circle depends on the radius of the circle. The rule that connects and is given by the equation . With each positive number there is associ-ated one value of , and we say that is a function of . B. The human population of the world depends on the time . The table gives estimates of the world population at time for certain years. For instance, But for each value of the time there is a corresponding value of and we say that is a function of . C.

abstract = { This paper analyzes the problem of weak instruments on identification, estimation, and inference in a simple nonparametric model of a triangular system. The paper derives a necessary and sufficient rank condition for identification, based on which weak identification is established. Then nonparametric weak instruments are defined as a sequence of reduced‐form functions where the associated rank shrinks to zero. The problem of weak instruments is characterized as concurvity , which motivates the introduction of a regularization scheme. The paper proposes a penalized series estimation method to alleviate the effects of weak instruments and shows that it achieves desirable asymptotic properties. A data‐driven procedure is proposed for the choice of the penalization parameter. The findings of this paper provide useful implications for empirical work. To illustrate them, Monte Carlo results are presented and an empirical example is given in which the effect of class size on test scores is estimated nonparametrically. },

abstract = {A semiparametric model for observational data combines a parametric form for some component of the data generating process (usually the behavioral relation between the dependent and explanatory variables) with weak nonparametric restrictions on the remainder of the model (usually the distribution of the unobservable errors). This chapter surveys some of the recent literature on semiparametric methods, emphasizing microeconometric applications using limited dependent variable models. An introductory section defines semiparametric models more precisely and reviews the techniques used to derive the large-sample properties of the corresponding estimation methods. The next section describes a number of weak restrictions on error distributions - conditional mean, conditional quantile, conditional symmetry, independence, and index restrictions - and show how they can be used to derive identifying restrictions on the distributions of observables. This general discussion is followed by a survey of a number of specific estimators proposed for particular econometric models, and the chapter concludes with a brief account of applications of these methods in practice. {\textcopyright} 1994 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Intangible assets, like patents and trademarks, are increasingly seen as the key to competitive success and as the drivers of corporate profit. Moreover, they constitute a major source of profit shifting opportunities in multinational enterprises (MNEs) due to a highly intransparent transfer pricing process. This paper argues that, for both reasons, MNEs have an incentive to locate intangible property at affiliates with a relatively low corporate tax rate. Using panel data on European MNEs and controlling for unobserved time-constant heterogeneity between affiliates, we find that the lower a subsidiary's corporate tax rate relative to other affiliates of the multinational group the higher is its level of intangible asset investment. This effect is statistically and economically significant, even after controlling for subsidiary size and accounting for a dynamic intangible investment pattern. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As a means for testing for the presence of influence across individuals, we discuss the concept of a stochastic choice function for a group of agents which allows observation of correlation structure (correlated choice rule). We ask when choice behavior is consistent with an underlying unobserved (latent) variable or signal which jointly governs preferences: this hypothesis represents absence of influence. Key is the property of marginality, which demands the independence of any given agents' budgetary choices from the budgets faced by the remaining agents. Marginality permits the construction of well-defined marginal stochastic choice functions. Marginality and non-negativity of an analogue of the Block-Marshack polynomials are equivalent to joint stochastic rationality for small environments. For larger environments, we offer an example of a correlated choice function establishing that each of the marginal stochastic choice functions may be stochastically rational while the correlated choice function is not. Thus, the detection of influence can be aided by studying correlated choice data.},

@book{Verhofen2004,
abstract = {SUMMARY: Introduction to the Economics and Mathematics of Financial Markets fills the longstanding need for an accessible yet serious textbook treatment of financial economics. The book provides a rigorous overview of the subject, while its flexible presentation makes it suitable for use with different levels of undergraduate and graduate students. Each chapter presents mathematical models of financial problems at three different degrees of sophistication: single-period, multi-period, and continuous-time. The single-period and multi-period models require only basic calculus and an introductory probability/statistics course, while an advanced undergraduate course in probability is helpful in understanding the continuous-time models. In this way, the material is given complete coverage at different levels; the less advanced student can stop before the more sophisticated mathematics and still be able to grasp the general principles of financial economics.The book is divided into three parts. The first part provides an introduction to basic securities and financial market organization, the concept of interest rates, the main mathematical models, and quantitative ways to measure risks and rewards. The second part treats option pricing and hedging; here and throughout the book, the authors emphasize the Martingale or probabilistic approach. Finally, the third part examines equilibrium modelsa subject often neglected by other texts in financial mathematics, but included here because of the qualitative insight it offers into the behavior of market participants and pricing.},

We first establish a general upper bound on the sup-norm (uniform) convergence rate of a sieve estimator, allowing for endogenous regressors and weakly dependent data. This result leads to the optimal sup-norm convergence rates for spline and wavelet least squares regression estimators under weakly dependent data and heavy-tailed error terms. This upper bound also yields the sup-norm convergence rates for sieve NPIV estimators under i.i.d. data: the rates coincide with the known optimal L{\^{}}2-norm rates for severely ill-posed problems, and are power of log(n) slower than the optimal L{\^{}}2-norm rates for mildly ill-posed problems. We then establish the minimax risk lower bound in sup-norm loss, which coincides with our upper bounds on sup-norm rates for the spline and wavelet sieve NPIV estimators. This sup-norm rate optimality provides another justification for the wide application of sieve NPIV estimators. Useful results on weakly-dependent random matrices are also provided.},

We also show in numerical calculations that the bounds may be very tight for small numbers of observations, suggesting they may be useful in practice. We propose two novel inference methods for parameters defined as solutions to linear and nonlinear programs such as marginal effects in multinomial choice models. We show that these methods produce uniformly valid confidence regions in large samples. We give an empirical illustration.},
