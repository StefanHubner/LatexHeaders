Le but est d'estimer de mani$\backslash$`ere nonparam$\backslash$'etrique la densit$\backslash$'e du coefficient al$\backslash$'eatoire. Il s'agit d'un probl$\backslash$`eme inverse mal pos$\backslash$'e caract$\backslash$'eris$\backslash$'e par une transformation int$\backslash$'egrale. Un nouvel estimateur de la densit$\backslash$'e du coefficient al$\backslash$'eatoire est propos$\backslash$'e. Il est bas$\backslash$'e sur les d$\backslash$'eveloppements en s$\backslash$'eries de Fourier-Laplace sur la sph$\backslash$`ere. Cette approche permet une $\backslash$'etude fine du probl$\backslash$`eme d'identification mais aussi d'obtenir un estimateur par injection ayant une expression explicite et ne n$\backslash$'ecessitant aucun optimisation num$\backslash$'erique. Le nouvel estimateur est donc tr$\backslash$`es facile $\backslash$`a obtenir num$\backslash$'eriquement, tout en $\backslash$'etant souple sur le traitement de l'h$\backslash$'et$\backslash$'erog$\backslash$'en$\backslash$'eit$\backslash$'e inobserv$\backslash$'ee.

@article{Fallis2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We study a general univariate smooth transition autoregressive, star, model. It contains as a special case the self-exciting threshold autoregressive, setar, model. We present three tests for testing linearity against star models and discuss their properties. The power of the tests in small samples is investigated by simulation when the alternative is the logistic star model. One of the tests is identical to Tsay's (1986) test statistic and is recommended only in a special case. Of the two remaining tests with wider applicability, one seems superior to the other in small samples. It is also more powerful than the cusum test recently proposed for testing linearity against setar models.},

abstract = {We develop a generally applicable framework for constructing efficient estimators of regression models via quantile regressions. The proposed method is based on optimally combining information over multiple quantiles and can be applied to a broad range of parametric and nonparametric settings. When combining information over a fixed number of quantiles, we derive an upper bound on the distance between the efficiency of the proposed estimator and the Fisher information. As the number of quantiles increases, this upper bound decreases and the asymptotic variance of the proposed estimator approaches the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao lower bound under appropriate conditions. In the case of non-regular statistical estimation, the proposed estimator leads to super-efficient estimation. We illustrate the proposed method for several widely used regression models. Both asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo experiments show the superior performance over existing methods.},

abstract = {It is proposed that satisfying, stable relationships reflect intimates' ability to see imperfect partners in idealized ways. In this study of the long-term benefits (or possible costs) of positive illusions, both members of dating couples completed measures of idealization and well-being 3 times in a year. Path analyses revealed that idealization had a variety of self-fulfilling effects. Relationships were most likely to persist-even in the face of conflicts and doubts-when intimates idealized one another the most. Intimates who idealized one another more initially also reported relatively greater increases in satisfaction and decreases in conflicts and doubts over the year. Finally, individuals even came to share their partners' idealized images of them. In summary, intimates who idealized one another appeared more prescient than blind, actually creating the relationships they wished for as romances progressed.},
