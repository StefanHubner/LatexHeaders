@article{Adesi1999,
abstract = {We propose filtering historical simulation by GARCH processes to model the future distribution of assets and swap values. Options' price changes are computed by full reevaluation on the changing prices of underlying assets. Our methodology takes implicitly into account as-sets' correlations without restricting their values over time or com-puting them explicitly. VaR values for portfolios of derivative securities are obtained without linearising them. Historical simulation assigns equal probability to past returns, neglecting current market condi-tions. Our methodology is a refinement of historical simulation. We are grateful to The London Clearing House for their financial support. We thank especially Andrew Lamb and Sara Williams for their continuous support and encouragement. We also thank David Bolton, Stavros Kontopanos, Clare Larter, and Richard Paine for providing programming as-sistance and Cassandra Chinkin for producing the empirical examples. Finally we would like to thank the two anonymous referees for their valuable comments.},

We show that it is possible to relax the positivity constraints on the parameters of the conditional variance. Unconstrained models provide a greater generality of the paths allowing for nonlinearities in the volatility. Cyclical behaviour is permitted as well as different relative impacts of positive and negative shocks on volatility, depending on their size. We give empirical evidence using French stock returns.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Fire is one of the most important crises in educational centers especially in laboratories. This work tried to develop a quantitative risk assessment model based on empirical data in an educational center, Azad University, Sciences and Research Branch. The more important issues were fuel and chemical leakage, high pressure reservoirs, hardware failure and ignition sources as well as the human errors in educational center. Building plan, occupancy and evacuation procedure, ability of hazard detection, safety measure, are very important in fire emergency condition. All of these parameters were used as input to the pattern of fire risk assessment. Offering a model based on analytical hierarchy process and failure mode and effect analysis logic, the current study aims to determine the factors influencing the fire risk of an education center. Testing the conceptual model for fire risk assessment was performed in the proposed site. The results showed that the laboratories and chemical warehouses could be raised the level of fire risk in an educational building.},
